	    <title>About <acronym>SIP</acronym> Express Router (<acronym>SER</acronym>)</title>
	    <para>
		SIP Express Router (<acronym>SER</acronym>) is an industrial-strength, free VoIP 
		server based on the Session Initiation Protocol (<acronym>SIP</acronym>, RFC3261). 
		It is engineered to power <acronym>IP</acronym> telephony infrastructures up to large 
		scale. The server keeps track of users, sets up VoIP sessions, 
		relays instant messages and creates space for new plug-in applications. 
		Its proven interoperability guarantees seamless integration with 
		components from other vendors, eliminating the risk of a single-vendor 
		trap. It has successfully participated in various interoperability 
		tests in which it worked with the products of other leading <acronym>SIP</acronym> vendors.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		The <acronym>SIP</acronym> Express Router enables a flexible plug-in model for new 
		applications: Third parties can easily link their plug-ins with 
		the server code and provide thereby advanced and customized services. 
		In this way, plug-ins such as RADIUS accounting,
		SMS gateway, ENUM queries, or presence agent have already been developed and are provided as 
		advanced features. Other modules are underway: 
		firewall control, postgress and LDAP database drivers and more.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		Its performance and robustness allows it to serve millions of users 
		and accommodate needs of very large operators. With a $3000 dual-CPU PC, the 
		<acronym>SIP</acronym> Express Router is able to power <acronym>IP</acronym> telephony services in an area 
		as large as the Bay Area during peak hours. Even on an IPAQ <acronym>PDA</acronym>, the server 
		withstands 150 calls per second (<acronym>CPS</acronym>)! The server has been powering our 
		iptel.org free <acronym>SIP</acronym> site withstanding heavy daily load that is further 
		increasing with the popularity of Microsoft's Windows Messenger.  
	    </para>
	    <para>
		The <acronym>SIP</acronym> Express Router is extremely configurable to allow the creation of 
		various routing and admission policies as well as setting up new and 
		customized services. Its configurability allows it to serve many roles: 
		network security barrier, application server, or <acronym>PSTN</acronym> gateway guard for 
		example.

		    <listitem>
			<para>
			    <emphasis>Speed</emphasis> - With <application>ser</application>, 
			    thousands of calls per seconds are achievable 
			    even on low-cost platforms. This competitive capacity allows 
			    setting up networks which are inexpensive and easy to manage 
			    due to low number of devices required. The processing capacity 
			    makes dealing with many stress factors easier. The stress
			    factors may include but are not limited to broken configurations and implementations,
			    boot avalanches on power-up, high-traffic applications such as presence, 
			    redundancy replications and denial-of-service attacks.
			</para>
			<para> The speed has been achieved by extensive code optimization, use of customized code,

	    <title>Use Cases</title>
	    <para>
		This section illustrates the most frequent uses of SIP. In all these scenarios, 
		the SIP Express Router (SER) can be easily deployed as the glue connecting all 
		SIP components together, be it soft-phones, hard-phones, PSTN gateways or any other 
		SIP-compliant devices.
	    </para>
	    <section>
		<title>Added-Value ISP Services</title>
		<para>
		    To attract customers, ISPs frequently offer applications bundled with IP access. 
		    With SIP, the providers can conveniently offer a variety of services running on top 
		    of a single infrastructure. Particularly, deploying VoIP and instant messaging and 
		    presence services is as easy as setting up a SIP server and guiding customers to use 
		    Windows Messenger. Additionally, the ISPs may offer advanced services such as PSTN 
		    termination, user-driven call handling or unified messaging all using the same infrastructure.
		</para>
		<para>
		    SIP Express Router has been engineered to power large scale networks: its capacity can deal 
		    with large number of customers under high load caused by modern applications. Premium 
		    performance allows deploying a low number of boxes while keeping investments and operational 
		    expenses extremely low. ISPs can offer SIP-based instant messaging services and interface
		    them to other instant messaging systems (Jabber, SMS). VoIP can be easily integrated along
		    with added-value services, such as voicemail.

		<title>PC2Phone</title>
		<para>
		    Internet Telephony Service Providers (ITSPs) offer the service of interconnecting 
		    Internet telephony users using PC softphone or appliances to PSTN. Particularly with 
		    long-distance and international calls, competitive pricing can be achieved by 
		    routing the calls over the Internet.
		</para>
		<para>
		    SIP Express Router can be easily configured to serve pc2phone users, distribute
		    calls to geographically appropriate PSTN gateway, act as a security barrier and keep 
		    track of charging. 
		</para>

	    <section>
		<title>PBX Replacement</title>
		<para>
		    Replacing a traditional PBX in an enterprise can achieve reasonable 
		    savings. Enterprises can deploy a single infrastructure for both voice 
		    and data and bridge distant locations over the Internet. Additionally, they can 
		    benefit of integration of voice and data.
		</para>
		<para>
		    The SIP Express Router scales from SOHOs to large, international enterprises. 
		    Even a single installation on a common PC is able to serve VoIP signaling of any 
		    world's enterprise. Its policy-based routing language makes implementation of numbering 
		    plans of companies spread across the world very easy. ACL features allow for protection of 
		    PSTN gateway from unauthorized callers.
		</para>
		<para>
		    SIP Express Router's support for programmable routing and accounting efficiently allows for 
		    implementation of such a scenario.

	<section id="aboutsip">
	    <title>About SIP Technology</title>
	    <para>
		The SIP protocol family is the technology which integrates services. 
		With SIP, Internet users can easily contact each other; figure out 
		willingness to have a conversation and couple different applications such as VoIP, video 
		and instant messaging. Integration with added-value services is seamless and easy. Examples 
		include integration with web (click-to-dial), E-mail (voice2email, UMS), and PSTN-like 
		services (conditional forwarding).
	    </para>
	    <para>
		The core piece of the technology is the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP, RFC3261) standardized by IETF. 
		Its main function is to establish communication sessions between users connected to the public 
		Internet and identified by e-mail-like addresses. One of SIP's greatest features is its transparent 
		support for multiple applications: the same infrastructure may be used for voice, video, gaming 
		or instant messaging as well as any other communication application.
	    </para>
	    <para>
		There are numerous scenarios in which SIP is already deployed: PBX replacement allows for 
		deployment of single inexpensive infrastructure in enterprises; PC-2-phone long-distance 
		services (e.g., Deltathree) cut callers long-distance expenses; instant messaging offered 
		by public severs (e.g., iptel.org) combines voice and text services with presence information. 
		New deployment scenarios are underway: SIP is a part of UMTS networks and research publications 
		suggest the use of SIP for virtual home environments or distributed network games.

			<para>
			    Script processing of multiple branches on forking
			</para>

			<warning>
			    <para>
				<application>ser</application>'s request processing language allows 
				to make request decisions based on current URI. 
				When a request if forked to multiple destinations, only the first branch's URI is used as 
				input for script processing. This might lead to unexpected results. Whenever a URI resolves 
				to multiple different next-hop URIs, only the first is processed which may result in handling 
				not appropriate for the other branch. For example, a URI might resolve to an IP phone SIP 
				address and PSTN gateway SIP address. If the IP phone address is the first, then script 
				execution ignores the second branch. If a script includes checking gateway address in
				request URI, the checks never match. That might result in ignoring of 
				gateway admission control rules or applying them unnecessarily to non-gateway 
				destinations.
