Why do we need to authenticate? My understanding was that you would like
to challenge in case someone was claiming your domain in From and trying
to get it rubberstamped by your domain's proxy. Do we need to worry about
a BYE from 0123@foo to 0321@foo? Well, I think so, to avoid relaying
(spam). That could be accomplished by challenging any requests to outside 
domains. The question then is what realm should we use? We don't know
it any longer, and we don't want to keep sessions. Keeping it with
record-routing might be an option.

Juha:
yes, the proxy would not know the realm unless it keeps dialog state.
more that authentication, i'm worried about accounting.  if my policy is
to account dialogs (calls) that are initiated by my own users, how do i
know when i see a bye, if it terminates such a call or a call initiated
by non-local party?


Mike Graff, serusers
--------------------
I implemented something much like this:

if (to me):
        if register
                www_authorize or fail if not a valid register
                done
        if claiming to be "From" one of the domains I accept
        registrations for
                proxy_authorize
                done
if not to me (I'm relaying for a local phone to an external address)
        proxy_authorize (once again, based on from address)
        done


Another Concern Raised by Juha
------------------------------
What if users with valid credentials in a domain will call
someone, whose SIP address is rededirected/referred/forwarded
to an accounted PSTN destination? Callers will then "dial"
a sip URI (bob@iptel) which will be turned without their
awareness to (900-666666@iptel), challenged by gateway,
automatically answered by most of existing software today
and accounted then.

Solutions?
- don't submit credentials automatically in UAC if challenge uri!=
  dialing uri; pop up a confirmation prompt in UA
- challenge with a different realm which will take authentication
- be restrictive and ban forwarding, REFERs, 3xx
