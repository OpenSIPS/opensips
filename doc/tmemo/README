This directory contains short technical memos documenting 
best practices and technical decisions made or proposed
for ser or accompanying applications. The memos serve as 
requests for comments in the literal sense (not to be confused
with IETF's RFCs).

The documents here are drafts, for whose technical maturity
no guarantee can be provided.  They may advocate non-workable
design ideas, frequently change, or be replaced by better
technology suggestions. They may or may not be implemented.

The memo texts follows IETF traditions: they are encoded
in plain ASCII. Their filenames consists of
 - tmemo (=technical memo -- to avoid confusion with IETF prefixes)
 - author id
 - text id
For example: tmemo-johndoe-backtobackua.txt
No version numbers are used in filename -- these are displayed 
in text and assigned by CVS server.
