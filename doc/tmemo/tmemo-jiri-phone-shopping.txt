jiri's SIP phone shopping list
------------------------------

This is Jiri's list of wishes for SIP "hardphones". When there is such
a phone, I will be glad to test it, promote it, and praise the vendor.

I) MUSTs

Without MUSTs, I will not like the phone.

- Price - get it bellow $100 (I mean for one phone, not for 10.000 of them)
- NAT-Traversal support: STUN, symmetric communication
- DNS fail-over, as required by specification (I'm aware of only one phones
  which is getting it right today, 2003-02)
- REFER (correctly please)
- reasonable provisioning
- the phones must be able to detect loss of Ethernet connectivity,
  display it, and re-REGISTER when reconnected

II) RECOMMENDED

With RECOMMENDED, I will do like the phone.

- multiple lines 
- multiple calls
- DTMF

III) SHOULD

With SHOULDs, I will fall in love with it.

- GIPS codec is good
- power-Ethernet
- desktop features: deny incoming call, DnD, 3-rd party conferencing,
  auto-repeat of failed call attempts
- well-readable display, at best backlit
- solid robust design, like with the PBX phones from well-established
  PBX vendors 

Note there are other lists too -- Henry Sinnreich's draft provides a great
dictate to phone vendors.

KNOWN ERRORs
------------
These are errors we observed frequently to fail in phones: digest/qop, 
DNS fail-over, REFER, transaction matching, record-routing.
