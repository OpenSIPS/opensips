		    Modules using database have variable called db_url which contains username,
		    password, hostname, and name of the database. Make sure the settings are
		    correct. See module documentation for more information.

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    Why do I need a database ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    Many modules need the database. Authentication modules retrieve users'
		    crecentials from the database, user location module can be configured to store
		    registered bindings into the database, accounting module can use database to
		    store CDR and so on.

	    <question>
		<simpara>
		    Which database engine should I use ?
		</simpara>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<simpara>
		    That depends on your requirements. Performance aspects are probably not very
		    important. The most stable and proven is MySQL module. Also serctl utility works
		    well with this database.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Another option is postgres support which was donated by Greg Faustak. The module
		    still new and not that mature (read proven) yet. People using the module
		    reported that it worked well.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Last option is dbtext module which uses plaintext files to store the data. This
		    module is somewhat experimental and shouldn't be used for any serious
		    deployment. The module is quite slow, but it can fit well into small
		    instalations containing only a couple of users or demos where you need to change
		    the content of the database often by hand.
