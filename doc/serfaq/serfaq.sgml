		<question>
		    <simpara>
			I'd like to know if &ser; supports <acronym>CPL</acronym> and

			Yes, <acronym>CPL</acronym> is supported through cpl module, the module
			needs an external <acronym>CPL</acronym> interpreter written in Java. A C
			version is under development. There is no support for Java servlets. The

		<question>
		    <simpara>
			Do you have any thoughts on how it compares in deployability and features to
			the Vovida stuff or other options ? Also, are there any issues I should be
			thinking of that would make a commercial venture with &ser; difficult
			(licensing, scaling, etc..)
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			&ser; is licensed under &gnu; &gpl;. I would be surprised if any &sip;
			server available today would scale a bit better--we spent lot of work on
			performance, achieved thousands of <acronym>CPS</acronym> on a
			<acronym>PC</acronym>--I guess it will take lot of time until your demand
			hits this capacity.

		<question>

			Is it necesarry to have a <acronym>DNS SVR</acronym> Resource Record, as
			mentioned in the ser-Howto guide for connecting to &ser; ?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			No. It's nice to have it, but you can work arround it setting a normal A
			record for your domain. The <acronym>SRV</acronym> lookup will fall back to
			normal A lookup.

			We have a question regarding usrloc: where are the active sessions

		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			&ser; has no notion of active session. &ser; is a transaction-stateful proxy,
			that means it knows about transactions (INVITE transaction, BYE
			transaction), but it keeps no state if there is no transaction active.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			That means, it keeps state when an INVITE comes and until a final response
			to the INVITE is sent. The same for BYE.

			How do we deal with aliases? If for example uid=mic is authenticated, he is

			addressable with michael.dosser@comnect.at how is this accomplished with ser
			?
		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			Aliases are tied to user location. It uses a special table which has the
			same structure as user location table and includes an entry for each
			alias. You do not have to do something special for that. You have to create
			this table and then you can use serctl to add aliases.

			Do you know the reason why these messages appear and if it is possible to

		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			that usually occurs because Jabber server crashes or, for some unknown

			connected to Jabber network.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			There is no way to disable sending these messages. I may introduce a new

		    <simpara>
			Once the interoperability gets better, it could be worth implementing. It is

		    </simpara>
		</question>
		<answer>
		    <simpara>
			If you are using 0.8.10, it is a manual process--copy and paste
			<acronym>SQL</acronym> tables, have a table set for each served domain, and
			refer to the table names from your scripts. E.g.,
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			if (uri=~"domain1.com") { lookup("domain1"); ...
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			With 0.8.11 you can automate the process quite a lot. Authorization
			functions with realm set to empty value take domain name from &sip;
			requests. User location database keeps track of domains as well. The
			<quote>domain</quote> modules allows you to keep track of maintained domains
			in a way which does not take changing scripts.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			It is possible there are some magic options in domain/usrloc/auth_db/
			registrar/auth modules you need to turn on to enable multidomain
			operation--I don't remember these by heart, hopefuly some people
