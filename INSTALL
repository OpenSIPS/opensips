Installation Notes

Supported architectures: Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Win* (CYGWIN)
(for other architectures the Makefile must be edited)

Requirements:


- gcc
- bison or yacc (Berkley yacc)
- flex
- gmake (on Linux this is the standard "make")

Arhitecture Notes:

- FreeBSD: make sure gmake, bison & flex are installed
- Solaris: as above; you can use Solaris's yacc instead of bison
- Windows: it works in windows but you must install a recent cygwin version
	(http://www.cygwin.com/) and also install a newer regex library version
	(>=0.12). 
	

Compile:

make
(or gmake on non-Linux systems)
make modules 
or make modules exclude_modules="CVS print" etc.

Install(not done yet):

make prefix=/usr/local  install
