Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module is an implementation of an Apache Kafka producer.
   It serves as a transport backend for the Event Interface and
   also provides a stand-alone connector to be used from the
   OpenSIPS script in order to publish messages to Kafka brokers.

1.2. Kafka socket syntax

   'kafka:' brokers '/' topic ['?' properties]

   Meaning of the socket fields:
     * brokers - comma-separated list of the addresses (as
       host:port) of the Kafka brokers to connect to. These are
       the "bootstrap" servers used by the client to discover the
       Kafka cluster. This corresponds to the bootstrap.servers /
       metadata.broker.list configuration property.
     * topic - Kafka topic used to publish messages to.
     * properties - configuration properties to be transparently
       passed to the Kafka client library. The syntax is:
       'g.'|'t.' property '=' value ['&' 'g.'|'t.' property '='
       value] ...
       The g. or t. prefix before each property name specifies
       whether it's a global or topic level property, as
       classified by the Kafka library. Documentation for the
       supported properties can be found here.
       Note that some library properties have the topic. prefix as
       part of their name, but still fall under the global
       category.
       key=callid is an extra property that is not passed to the
       Kafka library and is interpreted by OpenSIPS itself. When
       enabling this property the record published to Kafka will
       also include the Call-ID of the current SIP message as key.

1.3. Kafka events syntax

   The event payload is formated as a JSON-RPC notification, with
   the event name as the method field and the event parameters as
   the params field.

   The record published to Kafka will also include the Call-ID of
   the current SIP message as key, if the key=callid property is
   provided in the event socket.

1.4. Dependencies

1.4.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * none.

1.4.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * librdkafka-dev

   librdkafka-dev can be installed from the Confluent APT or YUM
   repositories.

1.5. Exported Parameters

1.5.1. broker_id (string)

   This parameter specifies the configuration for a Kafka broker
   (or cluster) that can be used to publish messages directly from
   the script, using the kafka_publish() function.

   The format of the parameter is: [ID]kafka_socket, where ID is
   an identifier for this broker instance and kafka_socket is a
   specification similar to the Kafka socket syntax.

   The key=callid property does not have an effect for brokers
   configured through this parameter.

   This parameter can be set multiple times.

   Example 1.1. Set broker_id parameter
...
modparam("event_kafka", "broker_id", "[k1]127.0.0.1:9092/topic1?g.linger
.ms=100&t.acks=all")
...

1.6. Exported Functions

1.6.1.  kafka_publish(broker_id, message, [key], [report_route])

   Publishes a message to a Kafka broker (or cluster). As the
   actual send operation is done in an asynchronous manner, a
   report route may be provided in order to check the message
   delivery status.

   Returns 1 if the message was succesfully queued for sending or
   -1 otherwise.

   This function can be used from any route.

   The function has the following parameters:
     * broker_id (string) - the ID of the Kafka broker (or
       cluster). Must be one of the IDs defined through the
       broker_id modparam.
     * message (string) - the payload of the Kafka message to
       publish.
     * key (string, optional) - the key of the Kafka record to
       publish.
     * report_route (string, static, optional) - name of a script
       route to be executed when the message delivery status is
       available. Information about the message publishing will be
       available in this route through the following AVP
       variables:
          + $avp(kafka_id) - broker ID
          + $avp(kafka_status) - delivery status, 0 if succesfull,
            -1 othewise
          + $avp(kafka_key) - message key
          + $avp(kafka_msg) - message payload

   Example 1.2. kafka_publish() function usage
        ...
        $var(msg) = "my msg content";
        kafka_publish("k1", $var(kmsg), $ci, "kafka_report");
        ...
        route[kafka_report] {
                xlog("Delivery status: $avp(kafka_status) for broker: $a
vp(kafka_id)\n");
        }
        ...

1.7. Examples

   Example 1.3. E_PIKE_BLOCKED event

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "E_PIKE_BLOCKED",
  "params": {
    "ip": "192.168.2.11"
  }
}


   Example 1.4. Kafka socket

        kafka:127.0.0.1:9092/topic1?t.message.timeout.ms=1000&key=callid
