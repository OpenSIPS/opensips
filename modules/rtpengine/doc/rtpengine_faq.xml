	    <question>
		    <para>How do I migrate from <quote>rtpproxy</quote> or <quote>rtpproxy-ng</quote> to
		    <quote>rtpengine</quote>?</para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
		<para>
			For the most part, only the names of the functions have changed, with
			<quote>rtpproxy</quote> in each name replaced with <quote>rtpengine</quote>.
			For example, <quote>rtpproxy_manage()</quote> has become
			<quote>rtpengine_manage()</quote>. A few name duplications have also been resolved,
			for example there is now a single <quote>rtpengine_delete()</quote> instead of
			<quote>unforce_rtp_proxy()</quote> and the identical <quote>rtpproxy_destroy()</quote>.
		</para>
		<para>
			The largest difference to the old module is how flags are passed to
			<quote>rtpengine_offer()</quote>, <quote>rtpengine_answer()</quote>,
			<quote>rtpengine_manage()</quote> and <quote>rtpengine_delete()</quote>. Instead of
			having a string of single-letter flags, they now take a string of space-separated
			items, with each item being either a single token (word) or a <quote>key=value</quote>
			pair.
		</para>
		<para>
			For example, if you had a call <quote>rtpproxy_offer("FRWOC+PS");</quote>, this would
			then become:
		</para>
		<programlisting>
rtpengine_offer("force trust-address symmetric replace-origin replace-session-connection ICE=force RTP/SAVPF");
		</programlisting>
		<para>
			Finally, if you were using the second parameter (explicit media address) to any of
			these functions, this has been replaced by the <quote>media-address=...</quote>
			option within the first string of flags.
