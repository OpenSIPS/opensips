1.1. Overview

   The Perl Virtual Database (VDB) provides a virtualization
   framework for OpenSIPS's database access. It does not handle a
   particular database engine itself but lets the user relay
   database requests to arbitrary Perl functions.

   This module cannot be used "out of the box". The user has to
   supply functionality dedicated to the client module. See below
   for options.

   The module can be used in all current OpenSIPS modules that
   need database access. Relaying of insert, update, query and
   delete operations is supported.

   Modules can be configured to use the db_perlvdb module as
   database backend using the db_url_parameter:
modparam("acc", "db_url", "perlvdb:OpenSIPS::VDB::Adapter::AccountingSIP
trace")

   This configuration options tells acc module that it should use
   the db_perlvdb module which will in turn use the Perl class
   OpenSIPS::VDB::Adapter::AccountingSIPtrace to relay the
   database requests.

Chapter 2. Developer Guide

2.1. Introduction

   OpenSIPS uses a database API for requests of numerous different
   types of data. Four primary operations are supported:
     * query
     * insert
     * update
     * delete

   This module relays these database requests to user implemented
   Perl functions.

2.2. Base class OpenSIPS::VDB

   A client module has to be configured to use the db_perlvdb
   module in conjunction with a Perl class to provide the
   functions. The configured class needs to inherit from the base
   class OpenSIPS::VDB.

   Derived classes have to implement the necessary functions
   "query", "insert", "update" and/or "delete". The client module
   specifies the necessary functions. To find out which functions
   are called from a module, its processes may be evaluated with
   the OpenSIPS::VDB::Adapter::Describe class which will log
   incoming requests (without actually providing any real
   functionality).

   While users can directly implement their desired functionality
   in a class derived from OpenSIPS::VDB, it is advisable to split
   the implementation into an Adapter that transforms the
   relational structured parameters into pure Perl function
   arguments, and add a virtual table (VTab) to provide the
   relaying to an underlying technology.

2.3. Data types

   Before introducing the higher level concepts of this module,
   the used datatypes will briefly be explained. The OpenSIPS Perl
   library includes some data types that have to be used in this
   module:

2.3.1. OpenSIPS::VDB::Value

   A value includes a data type flag and a value. Valid data types
   are DB_INT, DB_DOUBLE, DB_STRING, DB_STR, DB_DATETIME, DB_BLOB,
   DB_BITMAP. A new variable may be created with
my $val = new OpenSIPS::VDB::Value(DB_STRING, "foobar");

   Value objects contain the type() and data() methods to get or
   set the type and data attributes.

2.3.2. OpenSIPS::VDB::Pair

   The Pair class is derived from the Value class and additionally
   contains a column name (key). A new variable may be created
   with
my $pair = new OpenSIPS::VDB::Pair("foo", DB_STRING, "bar");

   where foo is the key and bar is the value. Additonally to the
   methods of the Value class, it contains a key() method to get
   or set the key attribute.

2.3.3. OpenSIPS::VDB::ReqCond

   The ReqCond class is used for select condition and is derived
   from the Pair class. It contains an addtional operator
   attribute. A new variable may be created with
my $cond = new OpenSIPS::VDB::ReqCond("foo", ">", DB_INT, 5);

   where foo is the key, "greater" is the operator and 5 is the
   value to compare. Additonally to the methods of the Pair class,
   it contains an op() method to get or set the operator
   attribute.

2.3.4. OpenSIPS::VDB::Column

   This class represents a column definition or database schema.
   It contains an array for the column names and an array for the
   column types. Both arrays need to have the same length. A new
   variable may be created with
my @types = { DB_INT, DB_STRING };
my @names = { "id", "vals" };
my $cols = new OpenSIPS::VDB::Column(\@types, \@names);

   The class contains the methods type() and name() to get or set
   the type and name arrays.

2.3.5. OpenSIPS::VDB::Result

   The Result class represents a query result. It contains a
   schema (class Column) and an array of rows, where each row is
   an array of Values. The object methods coldefs() and rows() may
   be used to get and set the object attributes.

2.4. Adapters

   Adapters should be used to turn the relational structured
   database request into pure Perl function arguments. The
   alias_db function alias_db_lookup for example takes a user/host
   pair, and turns it into another user/host pair. The Alias
   adapter turns the ReqCond array into two separate scalars that
   are used as parameters for a VTab call.

   Adapter classes have to inherit from the OpenSIPS::VDB base
   class and may provide one or more functions with the names
   insert, update, replace, query and/or delete, depending on the
   module which is to be used with the adapter. While modules such
   as alias_db only require a query function, others -- such as
   siptrace -- depend on inserts only.

2.4.1. Function parameters

   The implemented functions need to deal with the correct data
   types. The parameter and return types are listed in this
   section.

   insert() is passed an array of OpenSIPS::VDB::Pair objects. It
   should return an integer value.

   replace() is passed an array of OpenSIPS::VDB::Pair objects.
   This function is currently not used by any publicly available
   modules. It should return an integer value.

   delete() is passed an array of OpenSIPS::VDB::ReqCond objects.
   It should return an integer value.

   update() is passed an array of OpenSIPS::VDB::ReqCond objects
   (which rows to update) and an array of OpenSIPS::VDB::Pair
   objects (new data). It should return an integer value.

   query() is passed an array of OpenSIPS::VDB::ReqCond objects
   (which rows to select), an array of strings (which column names
   to return) and a single string by which column to sort. It
   should return an object of type OpenSIPS::VDB::Result.

2.5. VTabs

   VTabs (virtual tables) provide a particular implementation for
   an adapter. The Alias adapter e.g. calls a function with two
   parameters (user, host) and expects a hash to be returned with
   the two elements username and domain, or undef (when no result
   is found). A sample VTab implementation for the Alias adapter
   demonstrates this technique with a Perl hash that contains the
   alias data.

   The standard Adapter/VTab pattern lets the user choose between
   three options on how to implement VTabs:
     * Single function. When a function is used as a virtual
       table, it is passed the operation name (insert, replace,
       update, query, delete) as its first parameter. The function
       may be implemented in the main namespace.

     * Package/class. The defined class needs to have an init()
       function. It will be called during the first call of that
       VTab. Addtionally, the package has to define the necessary
       functions insert, replace, update, delete and/or query.
       These functions will be called in a function context (first
       parameter is the class name).

     * Object. The defined class needs to have a new() function
       which will return a reference to the newly created object.
       This object needs to define the necessary functions insert,
       replace, update, delete and/or query. These functions will
       be called in a method context (first parameter is a
       reference to the object).
