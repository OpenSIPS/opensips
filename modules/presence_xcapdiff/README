Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The presence_xcapdiff is an OpenSIPS module that adds support
   for the "xcap-diff" event to presence and pua. At the moment,
   the module just registers the event but doesn't do any
   event-specific processing. The module will automatically
   determine if the presence and/or pua modules are present and if
   so it will register the xcap-diff event with them. This allows
   the module to automatically offer presence or pua related
   functionality simply based on the presence of the
   aforementioned modules in the OpenSIPS configuration, without
   any need for manual configuration.

   Registering the event with pua, allows the XCAP server to
   publish the xcap-event when some modification of a document
   happens. Registering the event with presence allows clients to
   subscribe to the event.

   The module is intended to be used with the OpenXCAP server
   (www.openxcap.org), although it doesn't contain any
   OpenXCAP-specific code and should be usable with any XCAP
   server.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * presence module - to enable clients to subscribe to the
       xcap-diff event package.
     * pua module - to be able to publish the xcap-diff event when
       some modification of a document happens.
     * pua_mi module - to enable pua to publish the xcap-diff
       event using the MI interface. This is needed if this module
       is intended to be used in conjunction with OpenXCAP.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

   (1) DevScore = author_commits + author_lines_added /
   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files
