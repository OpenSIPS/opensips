Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module exposes a script variable that provides basic
   parsing and manipulation of XML documents or blocks of XML
   data. The variable provides ways to access entire XML elements,
   their text content or their attributes. You can modify the
   content and attributes as well as adding or removing nodes in
   the XML tree.

   The processing does not take into account any DTDs or schemas
   in terms of validation.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   This module does not depend on other modules.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

     * libxml2 Most Linux and BSD distributions include libxml but
       the library can also be downloaded from: xmlsoft.org

1.3. Exported Parameters

   The module does not export any parameters.

1.4. Exported Pseudo-Variables

1.4.1. $xml(path)

   This module exports the $xml(path) variable.

1.4.1.1. Variable lifetime

   The xml variables will be available to the process that created
   them from the moment they were initialized. They will not reset
   per message or per transaction. If you want to use them on a
   per message basis you should initialize them each time.

1.4.1.2. Accessing the $xml(path) variable

   Accessing elements and attributes is based on the tree
   representation of the XML document thus a complete path from
   the root node is required. The in-memory equivalent of an XML
   document is an "XML object" which must be initilized with a
   well-formed block of XML data before use. In consequence, the
   path must start with the object name, followed by any number of
   nodes leading to the desired element.

   The grammar that describes the path is:

   path = name | name(identifier)+(acces)?

   identifier = element(index)?

   element = /string | /$var

   index = [integer] | [$var]

   access = .val | .attr/string | .attr/$var

   In order to select between nodes with identical names on a
   certain level in the tree, an index can be provided, starting
   from 0.

   The sequence of nodes in the path can be followed by .val in
   order to access the last node's text content or by
   .attr/attr_name in order to access it's attribute named
   attr_name. Otherwise the entire element (start-tag, end-tag,
   children elements and content) is accessed.

   Assiging NULL to the variable removes the entire element or
   it's text content or attribute acording to the access mode.

   If you want to insert an element, you must assign a string
   value (containg a well-formed block of XML data that has a root
   node) to the parent node. Note that assigning a value directly
   to a node does not replace it with that value.

   IMPORTANT: In XML all characters in the content of the document
   are significant including blanks and formatting line breaks. An
   element and it's content will be returned WITH all the
   whitespaces and newlines and when adding a new node under an
   existing one, if you want to insert it with indentation, you
   must include the needed characters in the assigned string.

   Other script variables can be used as element names, attribute
   names and indexes in the path. Variables that will be used as
   indexes must contain integer values. Variables that will be
   used as element or attribute names should contain string
   values.

   Example 1.1. Creating a document
...
$xml(my_doc) = "<doc></doc>";        # init object

$xml(my_doc/doc) = "<list></list>";  # add a "list" node

$xml(my_doc/doc/list) = "<item>some_value</item>";    # add an "item" no
de to the list

$xml(my_doc/doc/list) = "<item>another_value</item>"; # add another item
 to the list

$xml(my_doc/doc/list/item[1].val) = "new_val";        # set text content
 of previous item

$xml(my_doc/doc/list.attr/sort) = "asc";              # add attribute "s
ort" to list node

$xml(my_doc/doc/list.attr/sort) = NULL;               # remove previous
attribute

$xml(my_doc/doc/list/item[1]) = NULL;                 # remove second it
em

$xml(my_doc/doc/list.val) = "end";                    # add text content
 to list which now has
                                                      # mixed content

$xml(my_doc/doc/list.val) = NULL;                     # remove the text
content

xlog("$xml(my_doc/doc/list)\n");                      # display the enti
re list

xlog("$xml(my_doc)\n");                               # display the enti
re document

$xml(my_doc) = NULL;                                  # clear the entire
 document
...

   Example 1.2. Inserting nodes with indentation
...
$xml(my_doc) = "<doc>\n</doc>";
$xml(my_doc/doc) = "\t<list></list>\n";
$xml(my_doc/doc/list) = "\n\t\t<item></item>\n\t";

# this creates the following document:
# <doc>
#       <list>
#               <item></item>
#       </list>
# </doc>
#
# without the explicit formating characters the document would be:
# <doc><list><item></item></list></doc>
...

   Example 1.3. Using script variables in path
...
# accessing the attribute of second item in list
$var(my_list) = "list";
$var(my_idx) = 1;
$var(my_attr) = "sort";
xlog("$xml(my_doc/doc/$var(my_list)/item[$var(my_idx)].attr/$var(my_attr
))\n");
...

1.5. Exported Functions

   The module does not export any script functions.
