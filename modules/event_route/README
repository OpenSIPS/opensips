Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module provides a simple way for handling different
   events, triggered through the OpenSIPS Event Interface,
   directly from the OpenSIPS script. For a specific event, a
   special route (event_route) has to be declared in the script,
   and should contain the code that handles the event. The route
   is executed by the module when the corresponding event is
   raised by the OpenSIPS Event Interface.Since version 1.12, the
   way an event is handlend (sync/async) should be specified from
   the configuration script with the desired keyword following the
   name of the event (event_route[e, sync]).

1.2. ROUTE events parameters

   In order to retrieve the parameters of an event, the
   fetch_event_params(pvar_list) function is used. It receives a
   single parameter, that consists of a list of parameters names
   (optional) and the pseudo-variable where the values will be
   stored. The grammar is:

   [ param_name= ] pvar [; [ param_name= ] pvar ]*

   Example:
fetch_event_params("$avp(first_param)");
fetch_event_params("ip=$avp(pike_ip)");
fetch_event_params("source=$avp(src);destination=$avp(dst)");

   If the name of the parameter is not specified, the avp will be
   populated according to the order of the parameters, as exported
   by the event. The following code will populate the $avp(first)
   avp with the first parameter of the event, $avp(second) with
   the second one and so on.

   fetch_event_params("$avp(first);$avp(second);$avp(third)");

   NOTE: An event may be triggered within a different event,
   leading to nested processing. This function will retrieve the
   parameters of the currently processed event.

   The event name can contain any non-quoted string character, but
   it is recommended to follow the syntax:
   E_MODULE_NAME_EXTRA_NAME

1.3. EVENT_ROUTE usage

   In order to handle the E_PIKE_BLOCKED event, the following
   snippet can be used:

   Example 1.1. EVENT_ROUTE usage
        event_route[E_PIKE_BLOCKED] {
                fetch_event_params("ip=$avp(pike-ip)");
                xlog("IP $avp(pike-ip) has been blocked\n");
        }

1.4. EVENT_ROUTE socket syntax

   As the OpenSIPS Event Interface requires, the event_route
   module uses a specific socket syntax:

   'route:' event_name

   Example:

   route:E_PIKE_BLOCKED

1.5. Dependencies

1.5.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other OpenSIPS modules.

1.5.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none

1.6. Exported Parameters

   The module does not export parameters to be used in
   configuration script.

1.7. Exported Functions

1.7.1.  fetch_event_params(pvar_list)

   Retrieves the parameters of the event. For more information,
   please read Section 1.2, “ROUTE events parameters”.

   The the pseudo variables list as described in Section 1.2,
   “ROUTE events parameters”.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and EVENT_ROUTE.

   Example 1.2. fetch_event_params usage
...
fetch_event_params("$avp(first_param)"); # fetch the first parameter of
an event
fetch_event_params("ip=$avp(pike_ip)");  # fetch the ip parameter
fetch_event_params("source=$avp(src);destination=$avp(dst)"); # fetch th
e source and destination parameters
...

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

   Can I declare more routes for handling the same event?

   No, only a single event_route can be used for a particular
   event.

   2.2.

   Where can I find more about OpenSIPS?

   Take a look at http://www.opensips.org/.

   2.3.

   Where can I post a question about this module?

   First at all check if your question was already answered on one
   of our mailing lists:
     * User Mailing List -
