Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The Call Center module implements an inbound call center system
   with call flows (for queuing the received calls) and agents
   (for answering the calls).

   The module implements the queuing system, the call distribution
   to agents, agents managements, CDRs for the calls, statistics
   on call distribution and agent's activity - basically
   everything except the media playback (for the queue). This part
   must be provided via a third party media server (FreeSwitch,
   Asterisk or others).

1.2. How it works

   The main entities in the modules are the flows (queues) and
   agents.

1.2.1. DB tables

   Each entity has a corresponding table in the database, for
   provisioning purposes - the cc_flows and cc_agents tables, see
   DB schema. Data is loaded at startup and cached into memory ;
   runtime reload is possible via the MI commands (see the
   cc_reload command in Section 1.7, “Exported MI Functions”).

   Additionally there is a table cc_cdrs for writing the CDRs -
   this operation is done in realtime, after the call in
   completed, covering all possible cases: call was dropped while
   in queue, call was rejected by agent, call was accepted by
   agent, call terminated with error - NOTE that a call may
   generate more than one CDR (like call rejected by agent A, and
   redistributed and accepted by agent B).

   The cc_calls table is used to store ongoing calls, regardless
   it's state (in queue, to the agent, ended). It is populated at
   runtime by the module and queried at startup. This table should
   not be manually provisioned.

1.2.2. Call Flows

   A flow is defined by a unique alphanumerical ID - the main
   attribute of a flow is the skill - the skill is a capability
   required by the flow for an agent to be able to answer the call
   ; the concept of skills is the link between the flows and the
   agents - telling what agents are serving what flows - the flows
   require a skill, while the agents provide a set of skills.
   Agents matching the required skill of a flow will automatically
   receive calls from that flow.

   Additional, the flow has a priority - as agents may server
   multiple flows in the same time (based on skills), you can
   define priorities between the flows - if the flows has a higher
   priority, its calls will be pushed (in deliver to agents and
   queuing) in front of the calls from flows with a lower
   priority.

   Optionally, the flow may define a prependcid - a prefix to be
   added to the CLI (Caller ID) when the call is delivered to the
   agents - as an agent may receive call from multiple flows, it
   is important for the user to see which was the queue a call was
   received.

   In terms of media announcements, the flow defines the
   message_welcome (optional, to be played in the call, before
   doing anything with the call) and message_queue (mandatory, the
   looping message providing infinite on hold media IMPORTANT -
   this message must cycle and media server must never hung up on
   it. Both announcements are provided as SIP URIs (where the call
   has to be sent in order to get the playback).

1.2.3. Agents

   An agent is defined by a unique alphanumerical ID - the main
   attribute of an agent is its the set of skills and its SIP
   location. The set of skills will tell what calls to be received
   (from which flows, based on the skill matching); the location
   is a SIP URI where to call must be sent in order to be answered
   by the agent.

   Additionally, the agent has a initial logstate - if he is
   logged in or not (being logged in is a must in order to receive
   calls). The log state may be changed at runtime via a dedicated
   MI command cc_agent_login, see Section 1.7, “Exported MI
   Functions”.

   There is a wrapup_time defined, saying the time interval for an
   agent before getting a new call from the system (after he
   finished a call).

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * b2b_logic - B2bUA module
     * database - one of the SQL DB modules

1.3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. db_url (string)

   SQL address to the DB server -- database specific. This must be
   the Database holding the provisioning tables (cc_flows,
   cc_agents and cc_calls tables).
   If not explicitly set, the global OpenSIPS DB URL will be used.

   Example 1.1. Set db_url parameter
...
modparam("call_center", "db_url",
        "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost/opensips")
...

1.4.2. acc_db_url (string)

   SQL address to the DB server -- database specific. This must be
   the Database where the CDRs table (cc_cdrs) is located.
   If not explicitly set, the global OpenSIPS DB URL will be used.

   Example 1.2. Set acc_db_url parameter
...
modparam("call_center", "acc_db_url",
        "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost/opensips_cdrs")
...

1.4.3. b2b_scenario (string)

   The name of the B2B scenario that is used by the module for
   handling the calls in the queue. This is an advanced options
   and you should not change it unless you really understand what
   you are doing.

   The module provides an B2B scenario file
   scenario_callcenter.xml located in the module directory. The
   name of this scenario from this file (which must be loaded via
   the b2b_logic module) must match the b2b_scenario parameter.

   Default value is “call center”.

   Example 1.3. Set b2b_scenario parameter
...
modparam("b2b_logic", "script_scenario", "/etc/opensips/scenario_callcen
ter.xml")
modparam("call_center", "b2b_scenario", "call center")
...

1.4.4. wrapup_time (integer)

   Time for an agent between finishing a call and receiving the
   next call from the system. Even if there are queued calls, the
   module will not deliver call to agent during this wrapup
   interval.

   Default value is “30 seconds”.

   Example 1.4. Set wrapup_time parameter
...
modparam("call_center", "wrapup_time", 45)
...

1.4.5. queue_pos_param (string)

   The name of an SIP URI parameter to be used to report the
   position in the waiting queue when sending the call to media
   server for onwait/queue playback. The position 0 means it is
   the next call to be delivered to an agent.

   Default value is “empty(none)”.

   Example 1.5. Set queue_pos_param parameter
...
modparam("call_center", "queue_pos_param", "cc_pos")
...

1.5. Exported Functions

1.5.1.  cc_handle_call(flowID)

   This must be used only for initial INVITE requests - the
   function pushes the call to be handled by the call center
   module (via a certain flow/queue).

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   The flowID mandatory parameter is the ID of the flow to handle
   this call (push the call to that flow). This can be a variable
   or a static string.

   The function returns TRUE back to the script if the call was
   successfully pushed and handled by the Call Center engine.
   IMPORTANT: you must not do any signaling on the call (reply,
   relay) after this point.

   In case of error, FALSE is returned to the script with the
   following return codes:
     * -1 - unable to get the flow ID from the parameter;
     * -2 - unable to parse the FROM URI;
     * -3 - flow with FlowID not found;
     * -4 - no agents logged in the flow;
     * -5 - internal error;

   Example 1.6. cc_handle_call usage
...
if (is_method("INVITE") and !has_totag()) {
        if (!cc_handle_call("tech_support")) {
                send_reply("403","Cannot handle call");
                exit;
        }
}
...

1.5.2.  cc_agent_login(agentID, state)

   This function sets the login (on or off) state for an agent.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   The agentID mandatory parameter is the ID of the agent and the
   state is an integer value giving the new state - 0 means logged
   off, anything else means logged in.

   Example 1.7. cc_agent_login usage
...
# log off the 'agentX' agent
cc_agent_login("agentX","0");
...
