	<title>Overview</title>
	<para>
	The Call Center module implements an inbound call center system with call 
	flows (for queuing the received calls) and agents (for answering the 
	calls).
	</para>
	<para>
	The module implements the queuing system, the call distribution 
	to agents, agents managements, CDRs for the calls, statistics on 
	call distribution and agent's activity - basically everything 
	except the media playback (for the queue). This part must be provided via 
	a third party media server (FreeSwitch, Asterisk or others).
	</para>
	</section>

	<section>
	<title>How it works</title>
	<para>
	The main entities in the modules are the flows (queues) and agents.
	</para>
		<section>
		<title>DB tables</title>
		<para>
		Each entity has a corresponding table in the database, for 
		provisioning purposes - the <emphasis>cc_flows</emphasis> and 
		<emphasis>cc_agents</emphasis> tables, see
		<ulink url='http://www.opensips.org/Documentation/Install-DBSchema-1-11#AEN2361'>DB schema</ulink>.
		Data is loaded at startup and cached into memory ; runtime reload is 
		possible via the MI commands (see the <emphasis>cc_reload</emphasis> 
		command in <xref linkend="cc_mi_commands"/>).
		</para>
		<para>
		Additionally there is a table <emphasis>cc_cdrs</emphasis> for writing 
		the CDRs - this operation is done in realtime, after the call in 
		completed, covering all possible cases: call was dropped while in 
		queue, call was rejected by agent, call was accepted by agent, call 
		terminated with error - NOTE that a call may generate more than one 
		CDR (like call rejected by agent A, and redistributed and accepted by 
		agent B).
		</para>
		<para>
		The <emphasis>cc_calls</emphasis> table is used to store ongoing calls,
		regardless it's state (in queue, to the agent, ended). It is populated
		at runtime by the module and queried at startup. This table should not
		be manually provisioned.
		</para>
		</section>

		<section>
		<title>Call Flows</title>
		<para>
		A flow is defined by a unique alphanumerical ID - the main attribute 
		of a flow is the <emphasis>skill</emphasis> - the skill is a 
		capability required by the flow for an agent to be able to answer the 
		call ; the concept of <emphasis>skills</emphasis> is the link between 
		the flows and the agents - telling what agents are serving what flows 
		- the flows require a skill, while the agents provide a set of skills. 
		Agents matching the required skill of a flow will automatically 
		receive calls from that flow.
		</para>
		<para>
		Additional, the flow has a <emphasis>priority</emphasis> - as agents 
		may server multiple flows in the same time (based on skills), you can
		define priorities between the flows - if the flows has a higher 
		priority, its calls will be pushed (in deliver to agents and queuing) in
		front of the calls from flows with a lower priority.
		</para>
		<para>
		Optionally, the flow may define a <emphasis>prependcid</emphasis> - a
		prefix to be added to the CLI (Caller ID) when the call is delivered to
		the agents - as an agent may receive call from multiple flows, it is 
		important for the user to see which was the queue a call was received.
		</para>
		<para>
		In terms of media announcements, the flow defines the 
		<emphasis>message_welcome</emphasis> (optional, to be played in the 
		call, before doing anything with the call) and 
		<emphasis>message_queue</emphasis> (mandatory, the looping message
		providing infinite on hold media IMPORTANT - this message must cycle 
		and media server must never hung up on it. Both announcements are 
		provided as SIP URIs (where the call has to be sent in order to get
		the playback).
		</para>
		</section>

		<section>
		<title>Agents</title>
		<para>
		An agent is defined by a unique alphanumerical ID - the main attribute 
		of an agent is its the set of <emphasis>skills</emphasis> and its SIP
		<emphasis>location</emphasis>. The set of skills will tell what calls
		to be received (from which flows, based on the skill matching); the 
		location is a SIP URI where to call must be sent in order to be 
		answered by the agent.
		</para>
		<para>
		Additionally, the agent has a initial <emphasis>logstate</emphasis> - 
		if he is logged in or not (being logged in is a must in order to
		receive calls). The log state may be changed at runtime via a 
		dedicated MI command <emphasis>cc_agent_login</emphasis>, see 
		<xref linkend="cc_mi_commands"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
		There is a <emphasis>wrapup_time</emphasis> defined, saying the 
		time interval for an agent before getting a new call from the system 
		(after he finished a call).
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>
		<function>cc_handle_call(flowID)</function>

		flow/queue).
		</para>
		<para>
		This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.
		</para>
		<para>

		successfully pushed and handled by the Call Center engine. IMPORTANT: 
		you must not do any signaling on the call (reply, relay) after this
		point.
