# History:
# --------
# 2003-04-07 this is a hack, from serctl, to make work with postgres
#
# DISCLAIMER:
# I have yet to get this software working in my production environment.
# Everything compiles and runs, but not for long.  It may or may not be a
# good starting point for the ser postgres driver.
#
# I had a hard time with memory while developing this.
# So, I decided to incorporate some memory routines that
# I have been using for years.  This didn't fix the problem,
# but it did make memory management easier.
#
# The postgres driver requires that you have postgres installed
# on your system.  You can download this from: www.postgresql.org.
# For this I used postgres version 7.3.2, but I imagine almost any
# recent version should work.
#
# You will then need to have a postgres database somewhere, and it
# needs to have the tables created in it. Currently I am supporting
# 2 tables, location and subscriber.  The file createtables.txt contains
# the table definitions and index definitions.
# 
# You may wish to load the tables from a 0.8.10 database.  The script
# copy_to_psql can be modified to open your mysql database and it outputs
# the necessary commands to populate the tables of the postgres database.
#
# To use the postgres module in your ser.cfg file is just like using the
# mysql module. Ie:
# loadmodule "/usr/local/lib/ser/modules/postgres.so"
# 
# That's it.  Good luck.
