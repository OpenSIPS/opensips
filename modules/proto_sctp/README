Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The proto_sctp module is an optional transport module (shared
   library) which exports the required logic in order to handle
   SCTP-based communication. (socket initialization and send/recv
   primitives to be used by higher-level network layers)

   Once loaded, you will be able to define "sctp:" listeners in
   your script.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. sctp_port (integer)

   The default port to be used for all SCTP related operation. Be
   careful as the default port impacts both the SIP listening part
   (if no port is defined in the SCTP listeners) and the SIP
   sending part (if the destination SCTP URI has no explicit
   port).

   If you want to change only the listening port for STP, use the
   port option in the SIP listener defintion.

   Default value is 5060.

   Example 1.1. Set sctp_port parameter
...
modparam("proto_sctp", "sctp_port", 5070)
...

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

   After switching to OpenSIPS 2.1, I'm getting this error:
   "listeners found for protocol sctp, but no module can handle
   it"

   You need to load the "proto_sctp" module. In your script, make
   sure you do a loadmodule "proto_sctp.so" after setting the
   mpath.

   (1) DevScore = author_commits + author_lines_added /
   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files
