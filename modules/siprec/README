Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module provides the means to do calls recording using an
   external recorder - the entity that records the call is not in
   the media path between the caller and callee, but it is
   completely separate, thus it can not affect by any means the
   quality of the conversation. This is done in a standardized
   manner, using the SIPREC Protocol, thus it can be used by any
   recorder that implements this protocol.

   Since an external server is used to record calls, there are no
   constraints regarding the location of the recorder, thus it can
   be placed arbitrary. This offers huge flexibility to your
   architecture configuration and various means for scaling.

   The work for this module has been sponsored by the OrecX
   Company. This module is fully integrated with the OrecX Call
   Recording products.

1.2. How it works

   The full architecture of a SIP Media Recording platform is
   documented in RFC 7245. According to this architecture, this
   OpenSIPS module implements a SRC (Session Recording Client)
   that instructs a SRS (Session Recording Server) when new calls
   are started, the participants of the calls and their profiles.
   Based on this data, the SRS can decide whether the call should
   be recorded or not.

   From SIP signalling perspective, the module does not change the
   call flow between the caller and callee. The call is
   established just as any other calls that are not recorded. But
   for each call that has SIPREC engaged, a completely separate
   SIP session is started by the SRC (OpenSIPS) towards the SRS,
   using the OpenSIPS Back-2-Back module. The INVITE message sent
   to the SRS contains a multi-part body consisting of two parts:
     * Recording SDP - the SDP of the Media Server that will fork
       the RTP to the recorder.
     * Participants Metadata - an XML-formatted document that
       contains information about the participants. The structure
       of the document is detailed in RFC 7865.

   The SRS can respond with negative reply, indicating that the
   session does not need to be recorded, or with a positive reply
   (200 OK), indicating in the SDP body where the media RTP should
   be sent/forked. When the call ends, the SRC must send a BYE
   message to the SRS, indicating that the recording should be
   completed.

   Full examples of call flows can be found in RFC 8068.

1.3. Media Handling

   Since OpenSIPS is a SIP Proxy, it does not have any Media
   Capabilities by itself. Thus we need to rely on a different
   Media Server to capture the RTP traffic and fork it to the SRS.
   This module currently uses the RTPProxy module in OpenSIPS to
   instruct the RTPProxy Media Server to fork the RTP media to the
   SRS.

1.4. SRS Failover

   The siprec module supports failover between multiple SRS
   servers - when calling the siprec_start_recording() function,
   one can provision more SRS URIs, separated by comma. In this
   case, OpenSIPS will try to use them in the same order
   specified, one by one, until either one of them responds with a
   positive reply (200 OK), or the response code is one of the
   codes matched by the skip_failover_codes regular expression. In
   the latter case the call is not recorded at all.

1.5. Limitations

   This module only implements the SRC specifications of the
   SIPREC RFC. In order to have a full recording solution, you
   will also need a SRS solution such as Oreka - an open-source
   project provided by OrecX.

   Although this module provides all the necessary tools to do
   calls recording, it does not fully implement the entire SIPREC
   SRC specifications. This list contains some of the module's
   limitations:
     * There is no Recording Indicator played to the callee -
       since OpenSIPS continues to act as a proxy, there is no way
       for us to postpone the media between the caller and callee
       to play a Recording Indicator message.
     * Cannot handle Recording Sessions initiated by SRS - we do
       not support the scenario when an SRS suddently decides to
       record a call in the middle of the dialog.
     * OpenSIPS cannot be “queried” for ongoing recording sessions
       - this is scheduled to be implemented in further releases.

1.6. Dependencies

1.6.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * TM - Transaction module.
     * Dialog - Dialog module for keeping track of the call.
     * RTPProxy - RTPProxy module used for controlling the media
       forked.
     * B2B_ENTITIES - Back-2-Back module used for communicating
       with the SRS.

1.6.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.7. Exported Parameters

1.7.1. media_port_min (integer)

   The minimum value of the port used in the SDP sent to the SRS.
   This value should correlate to the port-range configured in the
   RTPProxy Media Server.

   Default value is “35000”.

   Example 1.1. Set media_port_min parameter
...
modparam("siprec", "media_port_min", 10000)
...

1.7.2. media_port_max (integer)

   The maximum value of the port used in the SDP sent to the SRS.
   This value should correlate to the port-range configured in the
   RTPProxy Media Server.

   Default value is “65000”.

   Example 1.2. Set media_port_max parameter
...
modparam("siprec", "media_port_max", 20000)
...

1.7.3. skip_failover_codes (string)

   A regular expression used to specify the codes that should
   prevent the module from failing over to a new SRS server.

   By default any negative reply generates a failover.

   Example 1.3. Set skip_failover_codes parameter
...
# do not failover on 408 reply codes
modparam("siprec", "skip_failover_codes", "408")

# do not failover on 408 or 487 reply codes
modparam("siprec", "skip_failover_codes", "408|487")

# do not failover on any 3xx or 4xx reply code
modparam("siprec", "skip_failover_codes", "[34][0-9][0-9]")
...

1.8. Exported Functions

1.8.1.  siprec_start_recording(srs, [group], [caller], [callee],
[rtpproxy_sock], [media_ip], [headers])

   Calling this function on an initial INVITE engages call
   recording to SRS(s) for that call. Note that it does not
   necessary mean that the call will be recorded - it just means
   that OpenSIPS will query instruct the SRS that a new call has
   started, but the SRS might decide that the recording is
   disabled for those participants.

   Note that the call recording is not started right away, but
   only when the call is actually answered - 200 OK is sent by the
   callee.

   Parameters:
     * srs (string) - a comma-separated list of SRS URIs. These
       URIs are used in the order specified. See
       siprec_srs_failover for more information.
     * group (string, optional) - an opaque values used by the
       SIPREC protocol to group calls in certain profiles.
     * caller (string, optional) - an XML block containing
       information about the caller. If absent, the From header is
       used to build the value from.
     * callee (string, optional) - an XML block containing
       information about the callee. If absent, the To header is
       used to build the value from.
     * rtpproxy_sock (string, optional) - the RTPProxy socket used
       for this call. If absent, the rtpproxy module will try to
       detect the proxy used for the initial call, based on the
       default set provisioned in the rtpproxy module.
     * media_ip (string, optional) - the IP that RTPProxy will be
       streaming media from. If absent 127.0.0.1 will be used.
     * headers (string, optional) - extra headers that are to be
       added in the initial request towards the SRS. NOTE: headers
       must be separated by \r\n and must end with \r\n.

   The function returns false when an internal error is triggered
   and the call recording setup fails. Otherwise, if all the
   internal mechanisms are activated, it returns true.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.4. Use siprec_start_recording() function with a
   single SRS
        ...
        if (!has_totag() && is_method("INVITE")) {
                $var(srs) = "sip:127.0.0.1";
                xlog("Engage SIPREC call recording to $var(srs) for $ci\
n");
                siprec_start_recording($var(srs));
        }
        ...

   Example 1.5. Use siprec_start_recording() function with
   multiple SRS servers
        ...
        if (!has_totag() && is_method("INVITE")) {
                $var(srs) = "sip:127.0.0.1, sip:127.0.0.1;transport=TCP"
;
                xlog("Engage SIPREC call recording to servers $var(srs)
for $ci in inbound group\n");
                siprec_start_recording($var(srs), "inbound");
        }
        ...

   Example 1.6. Use siprec_start_recording() function with custom
   XML values for participants
        ...
        $xml(caller_xml) = "<nameID></nameID>";
        $xml(caller_xml/nameID.attr/aor) = "sip:6024151234@10.0.0.11:509
0";
        $xml(caller_xml/nameID) = "<name>test</name>";
        siprec_start_recording($var(srs),,$xml(caller_xml/nameID));
        ...

   Example 1.7. Use siprec_start_recording() function with custom
   headers
        ...
        siprec_start_recording($var(srs),,,,,,"X-MY-CUSTOM_HDR: 1\r\n");
        ...
