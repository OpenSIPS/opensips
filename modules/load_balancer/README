Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The Load-Balancer module comes to provide traffic routing based
   on load. Shortly, when OpenSIPS routes calls to a set of
   destinations, it is able to keep the load status (as number of
   ongoing calls) of each destination and to choose to route to
   the less loaded destination (at that moment). OpenSIPS is aware
   of the capacity of each destination - it is preconfigured with
   the maximum load accepted by the destinations. To be more
   precise, when routing, OpenSIPS will consider the less loaded
   destination not the destination with the smallest number of
   ongoing calls, but the destination with the largest available
   slot.

   Also the module has the capability to do failover (to try a new
   destination if the selected one done not responde), to keep
   state of the destinations (to remember the failed destination
   and avoid using them agai) and to check the health of the
   destination (by doing probing of the destination and auto
   re-enabling).

1.2. How it works

   Please refer to the Load-Balancer tutorial from the OpenSIPS
   website:
   http://www.opensips.org/Documentation/Tutorials-LoadBalancing-1
   -9.

1.3. Probing and Disabling destinations

   The module has the capability to monitor the status of the
   destinations by doing SIP probing (sending SIP requests like
   OPTIONS).

   For each destination, you can configure what kind of probing
   should be done (probe_mode column):
     * (0) - no probing at all;
     * (1) - probing only when the destination is in disabled mode
       (disabling via MI command will competely stop the probing
       also). The destination will be automatically re-enabled
       when the probing will succeed next time;
     * (2) - probing all the time. If disabled, the destination
       will be automatically re-enabled when the probing will
       succeed next time;

   A destination can become disabled in two ways:
     * script detection - by calling from script the lb_disabled()
       function after try the destination. In this case, if
       probing mode for the destination is (1) or (2), the
       destination will be automatically re-enabled when the
       probing will succeed.
     * MI command - by calling the lb_status MI command for
       disabling (on demand) the destination. If so, the probing
       and re-enabling of this destination will be completly
       disabled until you re-enable it again via MI command - this
       is designed to allow controlled and complete disabling of
       some destination during maintenance.

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * Dialog - Dialog module
       freeswitch - only if "fetch_freeswitch_stats" is enabled..
     * Dialog - TM module (only if probing enabled)
     * database - one of the DB modules

   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.5. Exported Parameters

1.5.1. db_url (string)

   The URL pointing to the database where the load-balancing rules
   are stored.

   Default value is
   “mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost/opensips”.

   Example 1.1. Set db_url parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "db_url", "dbdriver://username:password@dbhost
/dbname")
...

1.5.2. db_table (string)

   The name of the DB table containing the load-balancing rules.

   Default value is “load_balancer”.

   Example 1.2. Set db_table parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "db_table", "lb")
...

1.5.3. probing_interval (integer)

   How often (in seconds) the probing of a destination should be
   done. If set to 0, the probing will be disabled as
   functionality (for all destinations)

   Default value is “30”.

   Example 1.3. Set probing_interval parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "probing_interval", 60)
...

1.5.4. probing_method (string)

   The SIP method to be used for the probing requests.

   Default value is “"OPTIONS"”.

   Example 1.4. Set probing_method parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "probing_method", "INFO")
...

1.5.5. probing_from (string)

   The FROM SIP URI to be advertised in the SIP probing requests.

   Default value is “"sip:prober@localhost"”.

   Example 1.5. Set probing_from parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "probing_from", "sip:pinger@192.168.2.10")
...

1.5.6. probing_reply_codes (string)

   A comma separted list of SIP reply codes. The codes defined
   here will be considered as valid reply codes for probing
   messages, apart for 200.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.6. Set probing_reply_codes parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "probing_reply_codes", "501, 403")
...

1.5.7. lb_define_blacklist (string)

   Defines a blacklist based on a lb group. This list will contain
   the IPs (no port, all protocols) of the destinations matching
   the given group.

   Multiple instances of this param are allowed.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.7. Set the lb_define_blacklist parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "lb_define_blacklist", "list= 1,4,3")
modparam("load_balancer", "lb_define_blacklist", "blist2= 2,10,6")
...

1.5.8. fetch_freeswitch_stats (integer)

   If enabled, the maximum value of a resource may also consist of
   FreeSWITCH Event Socket Layer URLs, e.g.
   "channels=fs://:password@freeswitch.example.com" or
   "channels=fs://user:password@127.0.0.1:8021". The default ESL
   port is 8021.

   OpenSIPS will establish a connection with the given socket and
   periodically update the internal maximum value of the given
   resource using statistics pushed by the FreeSWITCH box.

   The max value of a resource is updated every 20 seconds, as the
   stats arrive from FreeSWITCH. The update formula is shown below
   (FreeSWITCH stats are highlighted in bold):

   max_load = (Idle-CPU / 100) * (Max-Sessions - (profile_count -
   Sessions))

   Default value is “0” (disabled).

   Example 1.8. Set the fetch_freeswitch_load parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "fetch_freeswitch_stats", 1)
...

1.5.9. initial_freeswitch_load (integer)

   This parameter is only relevant for some seconds after module
   startup/reload, when no statistics from newly loaded FreeSWITCH
   ESL sockets have arrived, yet the routing of calls must remain
   unaffected. Any FreeSWITCH-enabled resource will inherit this
   value for the entire interval mentioned above (up to 20
   seconds!).

   Default value is “1000”.

   Example 1.9. Set the initial_freeswitch_load parameter
...
modparam("load_balancer", "initial_freeswitch_load", 200)
...

1.6. Exported Functions

1.6.1.  lb_start(grp,resources[,flags])

   The function starts a new load-balancing session over the
   available destinations. This translates into finding the less
   loaded destination that can provide the requested resources and
   belong to a requested group.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * grp - group id for the destinations; the destination may be
       grouped in several groups you can you for differnet
       scenarios; this can be a number or a variable containing a
       numerical value.
     * resources - string containing a semi-colon separated list
       of resources required by the current call.
     * flags - various flags to controll the LB algorithm ( or
       computing the available load on the system):
          + n - Negative availability - use destinations with
            negative availability (exceeded capacity); do not
            ignore resources with negative availability, and thus
            able to select for load balancing destinations with
            exceeded capacity. This might be needed in scenarios
            where we want to limit generic calls volume and always
            pass important/high-priority calls.
          + r - Relative value - the relative available load (how
            many percentages are free) is used in computing the
            load of each pear/resource; Without this flag, the
            Absolute value is assumed - the effective available
            load ( maximum_load - current_load) is used in
            computing the load of each pear/resource.
          + s - Pick a random destination if multiple destinations
            with the same load are found, instead of always
            picking first matched destination. This could help to
            offload an excessive load from the first destination
            and distribute load in situations when failed calls
            always routed to first destination, since they almost
            does not affect load counters of destinations.

   The function may return:
     * 1 (true) - if a new destination URI is set, pointing to the
       selected destination. NOTE that the RURI will not be
       changed by this function.
     * -1 (false) - generic internal error (memory allocation,
       parsing)
     * -2 (false) - no capacity available (detinations are up and
       available, but they do not have any availabe channels)
     * -3 (false) - no destinations available (the requested
       resources did not match any active destination)
     * -4 (false) - bad resources (requested resources do not
       exist)

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE and
   FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.10. lb_start usage
...
if (lb_start("1","trascoding;conference")) {
        # dst URI points to the new destination
        xlog("sending call to $du\n");
        t_relay();
        exit;
}
...

1.6.2.  lb_next()

   Function to be used to pull the next available (and less
   loaded) destination. You need to have an ongoing LB session
   (started with lb_start()).

   This function is mainly used for implementing failover for the
   LB destinations.

   The function may return:
     * 1 (true) - if a new destination URI is set, pointing to the
       selected destination. NOTE that the RURI will not be
       changed by this function.
     * -1 (false) - generic internal error (memory allocation,
       parsing)
     * -2 (false) - no capacity available (detinations are up and
       available, but they do not have any availabe channels)
     * -3 (false) - no more destinations available (the requested
       resources did not match any active destination)

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.11. lb_next() usage
...
if (t_check_status("(408)|(5[0-9][0-9])")) {
        /* check next available LB destination */
        if ( lb_next() ) {
                t_on_failure("1");
                xlog("-----------new dst is $du\n");
                t_relay();
                exit;
        }
}

...

1.6.3.  lb_start_or_next(grp,resources[,flags])

   This is just a wrapper function to simplify scripting. If there
   is no ongoing LB session, it acts as lb_start(); If there is an
   ongoing LB session, it acts as lb_next().

1.6.4.  load_balance(grp,resources[,flags])

   Old name of the lb_start_or_next() function.

   Take care, this will become obsolete.

1.6.5.  lb_reset()

   Function to stop and flush a current LB session. To be used in
   failure route, if you want to stop the current LB session (not
   to try any other destinations from this session) and to start a
   completly new one.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.12. lb_next() usage
...
if (t_check_status("(5[0-9][0-9])")) {
        /* check next available LB destination */
        if ( lb_next() ) {
                t_on_failure("1");
                xlog("-----------new dst is $du\n");
                t_relay();
                exit;
        }
} else if (t_check_status("(408)")) {
        lb_reset();
        if (lb_start("1","conference")) {
                t_relay();
                exit;
        }
}
...

1.6.6.  lb_is_started()

   Function to check if there is any ongoing LB session. Returns
   true if so.

   This function can be used in any type of route.

1.6.7.  lb_disable_dst()

   Marks as disabled the last destination that was used for the
   current call. The disabling done via this function will prevent
   the destination to be used for usage from now on. The probing
   mechanism can re-enable this peer (see the probing section in
   the beginning)

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE and FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.13. lb_disable_dst() usage
...
if (t_check_status("(408)|(5[0-9][0-9])")) {
        lb_disable_dst();
        if ( lb_next() ) {
                t_on_failure("1");
                xlog("-----------new dst is $du\n");
                t_relay();
        } else {
                t_reply("500","Error");
        }
}

...

1.6.8.  lb_is_destination(ip,port[,group[,active]])

   Checks if the given IP and PORT belongs to a destination
   configured in the load-balancer's list. Returns true if found
   and active (see the "active" parameter).

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   ONREPLY_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * ip and port - IP and PORT to be checked (any kind of
       variables are allowed, but take care as the PORT variables
       should have an integer value); A value 0 for the port means
       "any" - will match any port.
     * group - in what LB group the destination should be looked
       for; If not specified, the search will be in all groups.
     * active - if "1", the search will be performed only over
       "active" (not disabled) destinations. If missing, the
       search will consider any kind of destinations.

   Example 1.14. lb_is_destination usage
...
if (lb_is_destination("$si","$sp") ) {
        # request from a LB destination
}
...

1.6.9.  lb_count_call(ip,port,grp,resources[,undo])

   The function counts the current call as load for a given
   destination with some given resources. Note that this call is
   not going through the load-balancing logic (there are not
   routing decision taken for the call); it is simply counted by
   LB as ongoing call for a destination;

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * ip and port - IP and PORT to identify the destination the
       call has to be counted for.
     * grp - group id for the destinations; if no knows, "-1" will
       mean all groups.
     * resources - string containing a semi-colon separated list
       of resources required by the current call.
     * undo - (optional) if set to a non zero value, it will force
       the function to un-count - actually it will undo the
       counting of this call as load in the current LB session;
       this might be needed if we count call for particular
       resources and then need to un-count it.

   Function returns true if the call was properly taken into
   consideration for estimating the load on the destination.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, BRANCH_ROUTE and
   FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.15. lb_count_call usage
...
# count as load also the calls orgininated by lb destinations
if (lb_is_destination("$si","$sp") ) {
        # inbound call from destination
        lb_count_call("$si","$sp","-1","conference");
} else {
        # outbound call to destinations
        if ( !load_balance("1","conference") ) {
                send_reply("503","unavailable");
                exit();
        }
        # dst URI points to the new destination
        xlog("sending call to $du\n");
        t_relay();
        exit;
}
