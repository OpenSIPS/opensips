Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   qrouting is a module which sits on top of drouting, dialog and
   tm and performs live tracking of a series of essential gateway
   signaling quality indicators (i.e. ASR, CCR, PDD, AST, ACD --
   more details below). Thus, qrouting is able to adjust the
   prefix routing behavior at runtime, by dynamically re-ordering
   the gateways based on how well they perform during live
   traffic, such that:
     * well-performing gateways get prioritized for routing
     * gateways which show a degradation in signaling quality are
       demoted to the end of the routing list

1.2. Monitored Statistics

   The module keeps track of a series of statistics, for each
   drouting (prefix, destination) pair, where a "destination" may
   be either a gateway or a carrier. The statistics are:
     * ASR (Answer Seizure Ratio) - the percentage of telephone
       calls which are answered (200 reply status code).
     * CCR (Call Completion Ratio) - the percentage of telephone
       calls which are answered back by the gateway, excluding
       5xx, 6xx reply codes and internal 408 timeouts. The
       following is always true: CCR >= ASR.
     * PDD (Post Dial Delay) - the duration, in milliseconds,
       between the receival of the initial INVITE and the receival
       of the first 180/183 provisional reply (the call state
       advances to "ringing").
     * AST (Average Setup Time) - the duration, in milliseconds,
       between the receival of the initial INVITE and the receival
       of the first 200 OK reply (the call state advances to
       "answered"). The following is always true: AST >= PDD.
     * ACD (Average Call Duration) - the duration, in seconds,
       between the receival of the initial INVITE and the receival
       of the first BYE request from either participant (the call
       state advances to "ended").

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded for this module to work:
     * an SQL DB module, offering access to the "qr_profiles"
       table
     * tm
     * dialog
     * drouting

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. db_url (string)

   An SQL database URL.

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.1. Setting the db_url parameter

modparam("qrouting", "db_url", "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost/op
ensips")

1.4.2. table_name (string)

   The name of the quality-based routing profiles table.

   Default value is "qr_profiles".

   Example 1.2. Setting the table_name parameter

modparam("qrouting", "table_name", "qr_profiles_bak")

1.4.3. algorithm (integer)

   Quality-based destination selection/balancing algorithm to use.

   Possible values:
     * "dynamic-weights" - for each prefix, all destinations start
       with equal weights and receive an equal share of the
       traffic. As signaling statistics are gathered for the
       destinations, the ones which underperform will receive less
       traffic, based on the "penalty" columns of the qr_profiles
       table
     * "best-dest-first" - for each prefix, the 1st (i.e. best
       scoring) destination will receive all the traffic as long
       as its quality stays the same. Initially, all destinations
       start with a perfect score. This score may degrade if one
       or more signaling statistics fall below the "warn" or
       "crit" thresholds during routing, case in which the
       destinations will be sorted accordingly and traffic will be
       routed to the newly determined 1st position in the list
       NOTE: for optimal results when using the "best-dest-first"
       algorithm, the destinations must be provisioned in
       descending order of their expected quality! (i.e. best
       quality gateways must be placed towards the start of the
       list)

   Default value is "dynamic-weights".

   Example 1.3. Setting the algorithm parameter

modparam("qrouting", "algorithm", "best-dest-first")

1.4.4. history_span (integer)

   The duration (in minutes) that a gateway's statistics for a
   given call will be kept for.

   Default value is 30 minutes.

   Example 1.4. Setting the connection_timeout parameter

modparam("qrouting", "history_span", 15)

1.4.5. sampling_interval (integer)

   The duration (in seconds) of the statistics sampling window.
   Every sampling_interval seconds, the accumulated statistics
   during the most recent sampling window get added to each
   gateway, while the oldest sampled interval statistics are
   subtracted (rotated away) from each gateway.

   A lower value will lead to a closer to realtime adjustment to
   traffic changes, but it will also increase CPU usage and
   internal contention due to locking.

   Default value is 5 seconds.

   Example 1.5. Setting the connect_poll_interval parameter

modparam("qrouting", "sampling_interval", 5)

1.4.6. extra_stats (string)

   A semicolon-separated list of custom statistics to be
   additionally kept and monitored by the module. In order to
   gather these statistics, the module expects the script writer
   to call qr_set_xstat() whenever they want to increment a custom
   statistic for a (prefix, destination) tuple.

   Extra statistics come in two flavours: positive (a higher value
   is better, e.g. ASR) or negative (a lower value is better, e.g.
   PDD). The flavour determines the comparison operator to be used
   against the statistics's thresholds, and can be specified by
   prepending "+" or "-", respectively, in front of the
   statistic's name (see example below).

   The minimally accepted number of samples for each statistic may
   be changed using the optional /<min_samples> suffix. Default
   value: 30 samples (minimum).

   The thresholds and penalties for a custom statistic must be
   provided via the qr_profiles table, by extending it with 4
   columns for each extra statistic, named according to these
   templates:
     * warn_threshold_<STAT>
     * crit_threshold_<STAT>
     * warn_penalty_<STAT>
     * crit_penalty_<STAT>

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.6. Setting the extra_stats parameter

modparam("qrouting", "extra_stats", "+mos/60; +r_factor; -503_replies/10
0")

1.4.7. min_samples_asr (integer)

   The minimally accepted amount of sampled ASR statistics for
   each (prefix, destination) pair before they can be taken into
   account. As long as the number of samples stays below this
   limit, the ASR statistic of the pair is assumed to be healthy.

   Default value is 30.

   Example 1.7. Setting the min_samples_asr parameter

modparam("qrouting", "min_samples_asr", 50)

1.4.8. min_samples_ccr (integer)

   The minimally accepted amount of sampled CCR statistics for
   each (prefix, destination) pair before they can be taken into
   account. As long as the number of samples stays below this
   limit, the CCR statistic of the pair is assumed to be healthy.

   Default value is 30.

   Example 1.8. Setting the min_samples_ccr parameter

modparam("qrouting", "min_samples_ccr", 50)

1.4.9. min_samples_pdd (integer)

   The minimally accepted amount of sampled PDD statistics for
   each (prefix, destination) pair before they can be taken into
   account. As long as the number of samples stays below this
   limit, the PDD statistic of the pair is assumed to be healthy.

   Default value is 10.

   Example 1.9. Setting the min_samples_pdd parameter

modparam("qrouting", "min_samples_pdd", 15)

1.4.10. min_samples_ast (integer)

   The minimally accepted amount of sampled AST statistics for
   each (prefix, destination) pair before they can be taken into
   account. As long as the number of samples stays below this
   limit, the AST statistic of the pair is assumed to be healthy.

   Default value is 10.

   Example 1.10. Setting the min_samples_ast parameter

modparam("qrouting", "min_samples_ast", 15)

1.4.11. min_samples_acd (integer)

   The minimally accepted amount of sampled ACD statistics for
   each (prefix, destination) pair before they can be taken into
   account. As long as the number of samples stays below this
   limit, the ACD statistic of the pair is assumed to be healthy.

   Default value is 20.

   Example 1.11. Setting the min_samples_acd parameter

modparam("qrouting", "min_samples_acd", 30)

1.4.12. event_bad_dst_threshold (string)

   The minimally accepted quality of a (prefix, destination)
   combination, given as a quoted floating point number in the [0,
   1] interval. Whenever a (prefix, destination) combination
   receives a score below this threshold, the E_QROUTING_BAD_DST
   event will be triggered.

   Default value is NULL (not set).

   Example 1.12. Setting the event_bad_dst_threshold parameter

modparam("qrouting", "event_bad_dst_threshold", "0.5")

1.4.13. decimal_digits (string)

   The amount of decimal digits to use in logging or MI output.

   Default value is 2.

   Example 1.13. Setting the decimal_digits parameter

modparam("qrouting", "decimal_digits", 4)

1.5. Exported Functions

1.5.1.  qr_set_xstat(rule_id, gw_name, stat_name, inc_by, [part],
[inc_total])

   Provide a new sample value for an extra statistic on a given
   (prefix, gateway) combination. Extra statistics may be defined
   using the extra_stats module parameter.

   Parameters:
     * rule_id (integer) - database id of the drouting rule
       holding the prefix and its destinations
     * gw_name (string) - gateway to account the statistic for.
       The gateway must be part of the above rule's destinations.
     * stat_name (string) - statistic to account
     * inc_by (string) - quoted floating point number,
       representing the amount to add to the stat
     * part (string, optional, default: 'Default') - the drouting
       partition to use
     * inc_total (string, optional, default: 1) - the amount to
       add to the total stat counter. Usually, this value should
       be 1, but it may make sense to set it to 0 when a custom
       statistic needs to be set a 2nd, 3rd, etc. time across the
       duration of the same established call.

   This function can be used from any route.

   Example 1.14. qr_set_xstat() usage

# the MoS is set exactly once per call, so we can omit "inc_total"
$var(rule_id) = 1574;
$var(gw_name) = "GW-28";
$var(mos_score) = "4.28";
qr_set_xstat($var(rule_id), $var(gw_name), "mos", $var(mos_score));

1.5.2.  qr_disable_dst(rule_id, dst_name, [part])

   Within a given routing rule, temporarily remove the given
   gateway or carrier from routing, until they are re-enabled via
   qr_enable_dst() or qr_enable_dst. The removal effect will be
   lost on an OpenSIPS restart.

   Parameters:
     * rule_id (integer) - database id of the drouting rule
     * dst_name (string) - gateway or carrier to disable
     * part (string, optional) - drouting partition

   This function can be used from any route.

   Example 1.15. qr_disable_dst() usage

# the signaling quality for @rule_id through @dst_name is degrading, rem
ove it!
event_route [E_QROUTING_BAD_DST]
{
        qr_disable_dst($param(rule_id), $param(dst_name), $param(partiti
on));
}

1.5.3.  qr_enable_dst(rule_id, dst_name, [part])

   Within a given routing rule, re-introduce the given gateway or
   carrier into the routing process.

   Parameters:
     * rule_id (integer) - database id of the drouting rule
     * dst_name (string) - gateway or carrier to disable
     * part (string, optional) - drouting partition

   This function can be used from any route.

   Example 1.16. qr_enable_dst() usage

# the ban has expired, let's re-enable this gateway and see how it behav
es
qr_enable_dst($param(rule_id), $param(dst_name), $param(partition));
