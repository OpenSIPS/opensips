Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   qrouting is a module which sits on top of drouting, dialog and
   tm and performs live tracking of a series of essential gateway
   signaling quality indicators (i.e. ASR, CCR, PDD, AST, ACD --
   more details below). Thus, qrouting is able to adjust the
   prefix routing behavior at runtime, by dynamically re-ordering
   the gateways based on how well they perform during live
   traffic, such that:
     * well-performing gateways get prioritized for routing
     * gateways which show a degradation in signaling quality are
       demoted to the end of the routing list

1.2. Monitored Statistics

   The module keeps track of the following statistics, for each
   drouting gateway:
     * ASR (Answer Seizure Ratio) - the percentage of telephone
       calls which are answered (200 reply status code).
     * CCR (Call Completion Ratio) - the percentage of telephone
       calls which are answered back by the gateway, excluding
       5xx, 6xx reply codes and internal 408 timeouts. The
       following is always true: CCR >= ASR.
     * PDD (Post Dial Delay) - the duration, in milliseconds,
       between the receival of the initial INVITE and the receival
       of the first 180/183 provisional reply (the call state
       advances to "ringing").
     * AST (Average Setup Time) - the duration, in milliseconds,
       between the receival of the initial INVITE and the receival
       of the first 200 OK reply (the call state advances to
       "answered"). The following is always true: AST >= PDD.
     * ACD (Average Call Duration) - the duration, in seconds,
       between the receival of the initial INVITE and the receival
       of the first BYE request from either participant (the call
       state advances to "ended").

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded for this module to work:
     * an SQL DB module, offering access to the "qr_profiles"
       table
     * tm
     * dialog
     * drouting

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. db_url (string)

   An SQL database URL.

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.1. Set db_url parameter

modparam("qrouting", "db_url", "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost/op
ensips")

1.4.2. table_name (string)

   The name of the quality-based routing profiles table.

   Default value is "qr_profiles".

   Example 1.2. Set table_name parameter

modparam("qrouting", "table_name", "qr_profiles_bak")

1.4.3. history_span (integer)

   The duration (in minutes) that a gateway's statistics for a
   given call will be kept for.

   Default value is 30 minutes.

   Example 1.3. Setting the connection_timeout parameter

modparam("qrouting", "history_span", 15)

1.4.4. sampling_interval (integer)

   The duration (in seconds) of the statistics sampling window.
   Every sampling_interval seconds, the accumulated statistics
   during the most recent sampling windows get added to each
   gateway, while the oldest sampled interval statistics are
   subtracted (rotated away) from each gateway.

   A lower value will lead to a closer to realtime adjustment to
   traffic changes, but it will also increase CPU usage and
   internal contention due to locking.

   Default value is 5 seconds.

   Example 1.4. Setting the connect_poll_interval parameter

modparam("qrouting", "sampling_interval", 5)

1.4.5. event_bad_dst_threshold (integer)

   The minimally accepted quality of a gateway. If a destination
   (i.e. prefix + gateway combination) receives a score below this
   threshold, the E_QROUTING_BAD_DST event will be triggered.

   Default value is 5 (all stats are allowed to hit the WARN
   threshold simultaneously)

   Example 1.5. Setting the event_bad_dst_threshold parameter

modparam("qrouting", "event_bad_dst_threshold", 4)

1.5. Exported Functions

1.5.1.  qr_disable_dst(rule_id, dst_name, [part])

   Within a given routing rule, temporarily remove the given
   gateway or carrier from routing, until they are re-enabled via
   qr_enable_dst() or qr_enable_dst. The removal effect will be
   lost on an OpenSIPS restart.

   Parameters:
     * rule_id (integer) - database id of the drouting rule
     * dst_name (string) - gateway or carrier to disable
     * part (string, optional) - drouting partition

   This function can be used from any route.

   Example 1.6. qr_disable_dst() usage

# the signaling quality for @rule_id through @dst_name is degrading, rem
ove it!
event_route [E_QROUTING_BAD_DST]
{
        qr_disable_dst($param(rule_id), $param(dst_name), $param(partiti
on));
}

1.5.2.  qr_enable_dst(rule_id, dst_name, [part])

   Within a given routing rule, re-introduce the given gateway or
   carrier into the routing process.

   Parameters:
     * rule_id (integer) - database id of the drouting rule
     * dst_name (string) - gateway or carrier to disable
     * part (string, optional) - drouting partition

   This function can be used from any route.

   Example 1.7. qr_enable_dst() usage

# the ban has expired, let's re-enable this gateway and see how it behav
es
qr_enable_dst($param(rule_id), $param(dst_name), $param(partition));

   Reload all quality-based routing rules from the SQL database.

   MI FIFO Command Format:

opensips-cli -x mi qr_reload

1.6.2. qr_status

   Inspect the signaling quality statistics of the current
   history_span for all drouting gateways in all partitions, with
   various levels of filtering.

   Parameters:
     * partition (optional) - a specific drouting partition to

1.6.3. qr_disable_dst

   Within a given routing rule, temporarily remove the given
   gateway or carrier from routing, until they are re-enabled
   manually. The removal effect will be lost on an OpenSIPS
   restart.

   Parameters:

     * rule_id - database id of the drouting rule
     * dst_name - gateway or carrier to disable
