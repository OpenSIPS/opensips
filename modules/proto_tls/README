Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   TLS, as defined in SIP RFC 3261, is a mandatory feature for
   proxies and can be used to secure the SIP signalling on a
   hop-by-hop basis (not end-to-end). TLS works on top of TCP.
   DTLS, or TLS over UDP is already defined by IETF and may become
   available in the future. This module also implements TLS
   related functions to use in the routing script, and exports
   pseudo variables with certificate and TLS parameters.

1.2. History

   The TLS support was originally developed by Peter Griffiths and
   posted as a patch on SER development mailing list. Thanks to
   Cesc Santasusana, several problems were fixed and some
   improvements were added.

   The TLS support was simultaneously added in both projects. In
   SER, the support was committed in a separate “experimental” CVS
   tree, as patch to the main CVS tree. In OpenSIPS, the support
   was integrated directly into the CVS tree, as a built-in
   component, and is part of stable OpenSIPS since release
   >=1.0.0.

1.3. Scenario

   By the increased number of providers the SIP world is
   continuously growing. More users means more calls and more
   calls means a high probability for a user to receive calls from
   totally unknown people or, in the worst case, to receive
   unwanted calls. To prevent this, a defense mechanism must be
   adopted by the SIP provider. Since only the called user is
   fully able to classify a call as being unwanted, the SIP
   server, based on all information regarding the call should
   notify the user about the desirability of the call. Information
   like the caller domain, the received source or the incoming
   protocol can be very useful for a SIP server to establish the
   nature of the call.

   As this information is quite limited, is very improbable for a
   server to be able detect the unwanted calls - there are many
   calls that it cannot predict anything about its status (neutral
   calls). So, instead on alerting the called user about unwanted
   calls, the server can notify the user about calls that are
   considered trusted - calls for which the server is 100% sure
   there are not unwanted.

   So, a trust concept must be defined for SIP servers. Which
   calls are trusted and which are not? A call is trusted if the
   caller can be identify as a trustable user - a user about we
   have reliable information.

   Since all the user from its domain are authenticated (or should
   be), a SIP server can consider all the calls generated by its
   user as trusted. Now we have to extend the trust concept to the
   multi-domain level. A mutual agreement, between several
   domains, can establish a trusting relationship. So, a domain
   (called A) will consider also as trusted calls all the calls
   generated by user from a different domain (called B) and
   vice-versa. But just an agreement is not enough; since the
   authentication information is strictly limited to a domain (a
   domain can authenticate only its own user, not the user from
   other domains), there is still the problem of checking the
   authenticity of the caller - he can impersonate (by a false
   FROM header) a user from a domain that is trusted.

   The answer to this problem is TLS (Transport Layer Security).
   All calls via domain A and domain B will be done via TLS.
   Authentication in origin domain plus TLS transport between
   domains will make the call 100% trusted for the target domain.

   For such a mechanism to work, the following requirements must
   be met:
     * all UA must have set as outbound proxy their home server.
     * all SIP servers must authenticated all the calls generated
       by their own users.
     * all SIP servers must relay the calls generated be their
       user to a trusted domain via TLS.

   Based on this, a server can classify as trusted a call for one
   of its user only if the call is also generated by one of its
   users or is the call is received from a trusted domain ( which
   is equivalent with a call received via TLS). Untrusted call
   will be calls received from users belonging to untrusted
   domains or from users from trusted domains, but whose calls are
   not routed via their home server (so, they are not
   authenticated by there home servers).

   Once the server is able to tell if the call is trusted or not,
   the still open issue is about the mechanism used by server to
   notify the called user about the nature of the incoming call.

   One way to do it is by remotely changing the ringing type of
   the called user's phone. This can be done by inserting special
   header into the INVITE request. Such feature is supported by
   now by several hardphones like CISCO ATA, CISCO 7960 and SNOM.
   This phones can change their ringing tone based on the present
   or content of the "Alert-Info" SIP header as follows:
     * CISCO ATA - it has 4 pre-defined ringing types. The
       Alert-Info header must look like “Alert-info: Bellcore-drX
       EOH"” where X can be between 1 and 4. Note that 1 is the
       phone default ringing tone.
     * CISCO 7960 - it has 2 pre-defined ringing types and the
       possibility of uploading new ones. The “Alert-Info” header
       must look like “Alert-info: X EOH” where X can be whatever
       number. When this header is present, the phones will not
       change the ringing tone, but the ringing pattern. Normally,
       the phone rings like [ring.........ring..........ring]
       where [ring] is the ringing tone; if the header is present,
       the ringing pattern will be
       [ring.ring.........ring.ring........]. So, to be able to
       hear some difference between the two patterns (and not only
       as length), its strongly recommended to have a highly
       asymmetric ringing type (as the pre-defined are not!!).
     * SNOM - The “Alert-Info” header must look like “Alert-info:
       URL EOH"” where URL can be a HTTP URL (for example) from
       where the phone can retrieve a ringing tone.

   A script example which implements this scenario can be found in
   Section 1.8, “OpenSIPS with TLS - script example”.

1.4. Dependencies of external libraries

   OpenSIPS TLS v1.0 support requires the following packages:
     * openssl or libssl >= 0.9.6
     * openssl-dev or libssl-dev

   OpenSIPS TLS v1.1/1.2 support requires the following packages:
     * openssl or libssl >= 1.0.1e
     * openssl-dev or libssl-dev

1.5. Exported Functions

1.5.1.  is_peer_verified

   Returns 1 if the message is received via TLS and the peer was
   verified during TLS connection handshake, otherwise it returns
   -1

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.1. is_peer_verified usage
...
if (is_peer_verified()) {
        xlog("L_INFO","request from verified TLS peer\n");
} else {
        xlog("L_INFO","request not verified\n");
}
...

1.6. OpenSIPS Exported parameters

   All these parameters can be used from the opensips.cfg file, to
   configure the behavior of OpenSIPS-TLS.

1.6.1. listen=interface

   Not specific to TLS. Allows to specify the protocol (udp, tcp,
   tls), the IP address and the port where the listening server
   will be.

   Example 1.2. Set listen variable
...
listen = tls:1.2.3.4:5061
...

1.6.2. tls_port (integer)

   Sets the default TLS listening port.

   Default value is 5061.

   Example 1.3. Set tls_port variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_port", 5062)
...

1.6.3. tls_method [(string):](string)

   Sets the TLS protocol. The first parameter, if set, represents
   the id of the domain. TLS method which can be:
     * TLSv1_2 - means OpenSIPS will accept only TLSv1.2
       connections (rfc3261 conformant).
     * TLSv1 - means OpenSIPS will accept only TLSv1 connections
       (rfc3261 conformant).
     * SSLv3 - means OpenSIPS will accept only SSLv3 connections
     * SSLv2 - means OpenSIPS will accept only SSLv2 connections
       (almost all old clients support this).
     * SSLv23 - means OpenSIPS will accept any of the above
       methods, but the initial SSL hello must be v2 (in the
       initial hello all the supported protocols are advertised
       enabling switching to a higher and more secure version).
       The initial v2 hello means it will not accept connections
       from SSLv3 or TLSv1 only clients.

   Default value is SSLv23.

Warning

   Best is to use SSLv23, for extended compatibility. Using any of
   the other will restrict the version to just that one version.
   In fact, SSLv2 is disabled in the source code; to use it, you
   need to edit tls/tls_init.c

   If you want RFC3261 conformance and all your clients support
   TLSv1 (or you are planning to use encrypted "tunnels" only
   between different OpenSIPS proxies) use TLSv1. If you want to
   support older clients use SSLv23 (in fact most of the
   applications with SSL support use the SSLv23 method).

   Example 1.4. Set tls_method variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_method", "TLSv1")
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_method", "dom:TLSv1")
...

1.6.4. certificate [(string):](string)

   Public certificate file for OpenSIPS. It will be used as
   server-side certificate for incoming TLS connections, and as a
   client-side certificate for outgoing TLS connections. The first
   parameter, if set, represents the id of the domain.

   Default value is "CFG_DIR/cert.pem".

   Example 1.5. Set certificate variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "certificate", "/mycerts/certs/opensips_server_cer
t.pem")
modparam("proto_tls", "certificate", "dom:/mycerts/certs/opensips_server
_cert.pem")
...

1.6.5. private_key [(string):](string)

   Private key of the above certificate. I must be kept in a safe
   place with tight permissions! The first parameter, if set,
   represents the id of the domain.

   Default value is "CFG_DIR/cert.pem".

   Example 1.6. Set private_key variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "private_key", "/mycerts/private/prik.pem")
modparam("proto_tls", "private_key", "dom:/mycerts/private/prik.pem")
...

1.6.6. ca_list [(string):]((string)

   List of trusted CAs. The file contains the certificates
   accepted, one after the other. It MUST be a file, not a folder.
   The first parameter, if set, represents the id of the domain.

   Default value is "".

   Example 1.7. Set ca_list variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "ca_list", "/mycerts/certs/ca_list.pem")
modparam("proto_tls", "ca_list", "dom:/mycerts/certs/ca_list.pem")
...

1.6.7. ca_dir [(string):](string)

   Directory storing trusted CAs. The path contains the
   certificates accepted, each as hash which is linked to
   certificate file. The first parameter, if set, represents the
   id of the domain.

   Default value is "".

   Example 1.8. Set ca_dir variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "ca_dir", "/mycerts/certs")
modparam("proto_tls", "ca_dir", "dom:/mycerts/certs")
...

1.6.8. ciphers_list [(string):](string)

   You can specify the list of algorithms for authentication and
   encryption that you allow. The first parameter, if set,
   represents the id of the domain. To obtain a list of ciphers
   and then choose, use the openssl application:
     * openssl ciphers 'ALL:eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT'

Warning

   Do not use the NULL algorithms (no encryption) ... only for
   testing!!!

   It defaults to the OpenSSL default ciphers.

   Example 1.9. Set ciphers_list variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "ciphers_list", "NULL")
modparam("proto_tls", "ciphers_list", "dom:NULL")
...

1.6.9. dh_params [(string):](string)

   You can specify a file which contains Diffie-Hellman parameters
   as a PEM-file. This is needed if you would like to specify
   ciphers including Diffie-Hellman mode. The first parameter, if
   set, represents the id of the domain.

   It defaults to not set a dh param file.

   Example 1.10. Set dh_params variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "dh_params", "/etc/pki/CA/dh1024.pem")
modparam("proto_tls", "dh_params", "dom:/etc/pki/CA/dh1024.pem")
...

1.6.10. ec_curve[(string):](string)

   You can specify an elliptic curve which should be used for
   ciphers which demand an elliptic curve. The first parameter, if
   set, represents the id of the domain.

   It's usable only if TLS v1.1/1.2 support was compiled. A list
   of curves which can be used you can get by
                                openssl ecparam -list_curve

   It defaults to not set a elliptic curve.

1.6.11. verify_cert [(string):](string) and
require_cert[(string):](string)

   Technically, verify_cert activates SSL_VERIFY_PEER in the
   ssl_context. 'require_cert' does the same with
   SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT, which is only possible if
   SSL_VERIFY_PEER is also turned on. Since version 2.1, these
   parameters act have been reduced to only one. They act both on
   client side and server side if no domain specified, elseway
   they act on a specific domain, depending on the first
   parameter.

   These two parameters are used for incoming TLS connections,
   where OpenSIPS acts as server.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value for both is 1.

   Example 1.11. Set verify_cert & require_cert variable
...
# turn on the strictest and strongest authentication possible
modparam("proto_tls", "require_cert", "1")
modparam("proto_tls", "require_cert", "1:1")
modparam("proto_tls", "verify_cert", "0")
modparam("proto_tls", "verify_cert", "1:1")
...

1.6.12. tls_handshake_timeout (integer) and tls_send_timeout
(integer)

   Timeouts ... advanced users only

   Default value for both is 30.

   Example 1.12. Set tls_handshake_timeout & tls_send_timeout
   variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_handshake_timeout", 119)             # number
 of seconds
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_send_timeout", 121)                  # number
 of seconds
...

1.6.13. client_domain_avp (integer)

   This sets the interger AVP used for name based TLS server
   domains (please see tls_client_domain for more details).
   Setting the value to 0 disables name based TLS client domains.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is 0.

   Example 1.13. Set tls_client_domain_avp variable
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_client_domain_avp", "400")           # only i
nteger named AVPs are supported
...

1.6.14. server_domain, client_domain (string)

   If you only run one domain, the main one is enough. If you are
   running several TLS servers (that is, you have more than one
   listen=tls:ip:port entry in the config file), you can specify
   some parameters for each of them separately (not all the
   above).

   The wording 'TLS domain' means that this TLS connection will
   have different parameters than another TLS connection (from
   another TLS domain). Thus, TLS domains must are not directly
   related to different SIP domains, although they are often used
   in common. Depending on the direction of the TLS handshake, a
   TLS domain is called 'client domain' (=outgouing TLS
   connection) or 'server domain' (= incoming TLS connection).

   For example, TLS domains can be used in virtual hosting
   scenarios with TLS. OpenSIPS offers SIP service for multiple
   domains, e.g. atlanta.com and biloxi.com. Altough both domains
   will be hosted a single SIP proxy, the SIP proxy needs 2
   certificates: One for atlanta.com and one for biloxi.com. For
   incoming TLS connections, the SIP proxy has to present the
   respective certificate during the TLS handshake. As the SIP
   proxy does not have received a SIP message yet (this is done
   after the TLS handshake), the SIP proxy can not retrieve the
   target domain (which will be usually retrieved from the domain
   in the request URI). Thus, distinction for these domains must
   be done by using multiple sockets. The socket on which the TLS
   connection is received, identifies the respective domain. Thus
   the SIP proxy is able to present the proper certificate.

   For outgoing TLS connections, the SIP proxy usually has to
   provide a client certificate. In this scenario, socket based
   distinction is not possible as there is no dedicated outgoing
   socket. Thus, the certificate selection (selection of the
   proper TLS client domain) will be name based. For this purpose,
   TLS client domains can be associated with a name (e.g. the
   domain can be used as name). If the SIP proxy establishes a new
   outgoing TLS connection, it checks for the TLS client domain
   AVP (parameter tls_client_domain_avp). If this AVP is set (e.g.
   in OpenSIPS.cfg), OpenSIPS searches for a TLS client domain
   with the same name and uses the certificates defined in the
   respective tls_client_domain section.

   TLS client domains can also be socket based. If name based
   domains are disabled or no name based AVP is found, OpenSIPS
   searches for socket based TLS client domains. In this case the
   mapping between to the TLS client domain is done based on the
   destination socket of the underlying outgoing TCP connection.

   Note: If there is already an existing TLS connection to the
   remote target, it will be reused wether the TLS client domain
   AVP matches or not.

   NOTE: Make sure to also configure OpenSIPS to listen on the
   specified IP:port.

   NOTE: Except tls_handshake_timeout and tls_send_timeout all TLS
   parameters can be set per TLS domain. If a parameter is not
   explicit set, the default value will be used.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Example 1.14. Usage of tls_client_domain and tls_server_domain
   block
...

1.6.15. tls_crlf_pingpong (integer)

   Send CRLF pong (\r\n) to incoming CRLFCRLF ping messages over
   TLS. By default it is enabled (1).

   Default value is 1 (enabled).

   Example 1.15. Set tls_crlf_pingpong parameter
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_crlf_pingpong", 0)
...

1.6.16. tls_crlf_drop (integer)

   Drop CRLF (\r\n) ping messages. When this parameter is enabled,
   the TLS layer drops packets that contains a single CRLF
   message. If a CRLFCRLF message is received, it is handled
   according to the tls_crlf_pingpong parameter.

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.16. Set tls_crlf_drop parameter
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_crlf_drop", 1)
...

1.6.17. tls_max_msg_chunks (integer)

   The maximum number of chunks that a SIP message is expected to
   arrive via TLS. If a packet is received more fragmented than
   this, the connection is dropped (either the connection is very
   overloaded and this leads to high fragmentation - or we are the
   victim of an ongoing attack where the attacker is sending the
   traffic very fragmented in order to decrease our performance).

   Default value is 4.

   Example 1.17. Set tls_max_msg_chunks parameter
...
modparam("proto_tls", "tls_max_msg_chunks", 8)
...

1.7. Pseudo-Variables

1.8. OpenSIPS with TLS - script example

   IMPORTANT: The TLS support is based on TCP, and for allowing
   OpenSIPS to use TCP, it must be started in multi-process mode.
   So, there is a must to have the "fork" parameter set to "yes":

   NOTE: Since the TLS engine is quite memory consuming, increase
   the used memory by the run time parameter "-m" (see OpenSIPS -h
   for more details).
     * fork = yes

   Example 1.19. Script with TLS support

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

       Where can I post a question about TLS?

       Use one (the most appropriate) of the OpenSIPS mailing lists:
         * User Mailing List -
           http://lists.opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/users
         * Developer Mailing List -
           http://lists.opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel

       Remember: first at all, check if your question wasn't already
       answered.

   2.2.

       How can I report a bug?

       Accumulate as much as possible information (OpenSIPS version,
       opensips -V output, your OS (uname -a), OpenSIPS logs, network
       dumps, core dump files, configuration file) and send a mail to
       http://lists.opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel

       Also you may try OpenSIPS's bug report web page:
       http://www.opensips.org/pmwiki.php?n=Development.Tracker

   2.3.

       How can I debug ssl/tls problems?

       Increase the log level in opensips.cfg (debug=4) and watch the
       log statements in syslog.

       Install the ssldump utility and start it. This will give you a
       trace of the ssl/tls connections.

   2.4.

       What is the difference between the TLS directory and the TLSOPS
       module directory?

       The code in the TLS directory implements the TLS transport
       layer. The TLSOPS module implements TLS related functions which
       can be used in the routing script.

   2.5.

       Where can I find more about OpenSIPS?

       Take a look at http://www.opensips.org/.

   2.6.

       Where can I post a question about this module?

       First at all check if your question was already answered on one
       of our mailing lists:
         * User Mailing List -
           http://lists.opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/users
         * Developer Mailing List -
           http://lists.opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel

       E-mails regarding any stable OpenSIPS release should be sent to
       <users@lists.opensips.org> and e-mails regarding development
       versions should be sent to <devel@lists.opensips.org>.

       If you want to keep the mail private, send it to
       <users@lists.opensips.org>.

   2.7.

       How can I report a bug?

       Please follow the guidelines provided at:
       https://github.com/OpenSIPS/opensips/issues.
