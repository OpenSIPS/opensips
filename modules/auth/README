Chapter 1. User's Guide

1.1. Overview

   This is a generic module that itself doesn't provide all
   functions necessary for authentication but provides functions
   that are needed by all other authentication related modules
   (so called authentication backends).

   We decided to break the authentication code into several
   modules because there are now more than one backends
   (currently database authentication and radius are supported).
   This allows us to create separate packages so uses can install
   and load only required functionality. This also allows us to
   avoid unnecessary dependencies in the binary packages.
     _________________________________________________________

1.2. Dependencies

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other
   words the listed modules must be loaded before this module):

     * sl -- Stateless replies
     _________________________________________________________

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. secret (string)

   Default value is randomly generated string.

   Example 1-1. Setting secret module parameter
modparam("auth", "secret", "johndoessecretphrase")
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.2. nonce_expire (integer)

   Nonces have limited lifetime. After a given period of time
   nonces will be considered invalid. This is to protect replay
   attacks. Credentials containing a stale nonce will be not
   authorized, but the user agent will be challenged again. This
   time the challenge will contain stale parameter which will
   indicate to the client that it doesn't have to disturb user by
   asking for username and password, it can recalculate
   credentials using existing username and password.

   The value is in seconds and default value is 300 seconds.

   Example 1-2. nonce_expire example
modparam("auth", "nonce_expire", 600)   # Set nonce_expire to 600s
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.3. rpid_prefix (string)

   Prefix to be added to Remote-Party-ID header field just before
   the URI returned from either radius or database.

   Default value is "".

   Example 1-3. rpid_prefix
modparam("auth", "rpid_prefix", "Whatever <")
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.4. rpid_suffix (string)

   Suffix to be added to Remote-Party-ID header field after the
   URI returned from either radius or database.

   Default value is
   ";party=calling;id-type=subscriber;screen=yes".

   Example 1-4. rpid_suffix
modparam("auth", "rpid_suffix", "@1.2.3.4>")
     _________________________________________________________

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1. www_challenge(realm, qop)

   The function challenges a user agent. It will generate a
   WWW-Authorize header field containing a digest challenge, it
   will put the header field into a response generated from the
   request the server is processing and send the reply. Upon
   reception of such a reply the user agent should compute
   credentials and retry the request. For more information
   regarding digest authentication see RFC2617.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:

     * realm - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent
       should present to the user so he can decide what username
       and password to use. Usually this is domain of the host
       the server is running on.
       If an empty string "" is used then the server will
       generate it from the request. In case of REGISTER requests
       To header field domain will be used (because this header
       field represents a user being registered), for all other
       messages From header field domain will be used.
     * qop - Value of this parameter can be either "1" or "0".
       When set to 1 then the server will put qop parameter in
       the challenge. When set to 0 then the server will not put
       qop parameter in the challenge. It is strongly recommended
       to use qop parameter, however there are still some user
       agents that cannot handle qop parameter properly so we
       made this optional. On the other hand there are still some
       user agents that cannot handle request without qop
       parameter too.

   Example 1-5. www_challenge usage
...
if (www_authorize("iptel.org", "subscriber")) {
    www_challenge("iptel.org", "1");
};
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.4.2. proxy_challenge(realm, qop)

   The function challenges a user agent. It will generate a
   Proxy-Authorize header field containing a digest challenge, it
   will put the header field into a response generated from the
   request the server is processing and send the reply. Upon
   reception of such a reply the user agent should compute
   credentials and retry the request. For more information
   regarding digest authentication see RFC2617.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:

     * realm - Realm is a opaque string that the user agent
       should present to the user so he can decide what username
       and password to use. Usually this is domain of the host
       the server is running on.
       If an empty string "" is used then the server will
       generate it from the request. From header field domain
       will be used as realm.
     * qop - Value of this parameter can be either "1" or "0".
       When set to 1 then the server will put qop parameter in
       the challenge. When set to 0 then the server will not put
       qop parameter in the challenge. It is strongly recommended
       to use qop parameter, however there are still some user
       agents that cannot handle qop parameter properly so we
       made this optional. On the other hand there are still some
       user agents that cannot handle request without qop
       parameter too.

   Example 1-6. proxy_challenge usage
...
if (!proxy_authorize("", "subscriber)) {
    proxy_challenge("", "1");  # Realm will be autogenerated
};
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.4.3. consume_credentials()

   This function removes previously authorized credentials from
   the message being processed by the server. That means that the
   downstream message will not contain credentials there were
   used by this server. This ensures that the proxy will not
   reveal information about credentials used to downstream
   elements and also the message will be a little bit shorter.
   The function must be called after www_authorize or
   proxy_authorize.

   Example 1-7. consume_credentials example
...
if (www_authorize("", "subscriber)) {
    consume_credentials();
};
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.4.4. is_rpid_user_e164()

   The function checks if the SIP URI received from the database
   or radius server and will potentially be used in
   Remote-Party-ID header field contains an E164 number (+
   followed by up to 15 decimal digits) in its user part. Check
   fails, if no such SIP URI exists (i.e. radius server or
   database didn't provide this information).

   Example 1-8. is_rpid_user_e164 usage
...
if (is_rpid_user_e164()) {
                    # do something here
};
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.4.5. append_rpid_hf()

   Appends to the message a Remote-Party-ID header that contains
   header 'Remote-Party-ID: ' followed by the saved value of the
   SIP URI received from the database or radius server followed
   by the value of module parameter radius_rpid_suffix. The
   function does nothing if no saved SIP URI exists.

   Example 1-9. append_rpid_hf
...
append_rpid_hf();  # Append Remote-Party-ID header field
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.4.6. append_rpid_hf(prefix, suffix)

   This function is the same as Section 1.4.5. The only
   difference is that it accepts two parameters--prefix and
   suffix to be added to Remote-Party-ID header field. This
   function ignores rpid_prefix and rpid_suffix parameters,
   instead of that allows to set them in every call.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:

     * prefix - Prefix of the Remote-Party-ID URI. The string
       will be added at the begining of body of the header field,
       just before the URI.
     * suffix - Suffix of the Remote-Party-ID header field. The
       string will be appended at the end of the header field. It
       can be used to set various URI parameters, for example.

   Example 1-10. append_rpid_hf(prefix, suffix)
...
append_rpid_hf("", ";party=calling;id-type=subscriber;screen=yes");  #
Append Remote-Party-ID header field
...
