Chapter 1. User's Guide

1.1. Overview

   Exec module allows to start an external command from a ser
   script. The commands may be any valid shell commands--the
   command string is passed to shell using "popen" command. ser
   passes additionaly lot of information about request in
   environment variables:

     * SIP_HF_<hf_name> contains value of each header field in
       request. If a header field occured multiple times, values
       are concatenated and comma-separated. <hf_name> is in
       capital letters. Ff a header-field name occured in compact
       form, <hf_name> is canonical.
     * SIP_TID is transaction identifier. All request
       retransmissions or CANCELs/ACKs associated with a previous
       INVITE result in the same value.
     * SIP_DID is dialog identifier, which is the same as to-tag.
       Initially, it is empty.
     * SIP_SRCIP is source IP address from which request came.
     * SIP_ORURI is original request URI.
     * SIP_RURI is current request URI (if unchanged, equal to
       original).
     * SIP_USER is userpart of current request URI.
     * SIP_OUSER is userpart of original request URI.

1.5. Known Issues

   There is currently no guarantee that scripts ever return and
   stop blocking SIP server. (There is kill.c but it is not used
   along with the current mechanisms based on popen. Besides that
   kill.c is ugly).
