Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module offers support for instant message conference. It
   follows the architecture of IRC channels, you can send commands
   embedded in MESSAGE body, because there are no SIP UA clients
   which have GUI for IM conferencing.

   You have to define an URI corresponding to im conferencing
   manager, where user can send commands to create a new
   conference room. Once the conference room is created, users can
   send commands directly to conferece's URI.

   To ease the integration in the configuration file, the
   interpreter of the IMC commands are embeded in the module, from
   configuration poin of view, there is only one function which
   has to be executed for both messages and commands.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * mysql.
     * tm.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. db_url (str)

   The database url.

   The default value is
   “mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost/opensips”.

   Example 1.1. Set db_url parameter
...
modparam("imc", "db_url", "dbdriver://username:password@dbhost/dbname")
...

1.3.2. rooms_table (str)

   The name of the table storing IMC rooms.

   The default value is "imc_rooms".

   Example 1.2. Set rooms_table parameter
...
modparam("imc", "rooms_table", "rooms")
...

1.3.3. members_table (str)

   The name of the table storing IMC members.

   The default value is "imc_members".

   Example 1.3. Set members_table parameter
...
modparam("imc", "rooms_table", "members")
...

1.3.4. hash_size (integer)

   The power of 2 to get the size of the hash table used for
   storing members and rooms.

   The default value is 4 (resultimg in hash size 16).

   Example 1.4. Set hash_size parameter
...
modparam("imc", "hash_size", 8)
...

1.3.5. imc_cmd_start_char (str)

   The character which indicates that the body of the message is a
   command.

   The default value is "#".

   Example 1.5. Set imc_cmd_start_char parameter
...
modparam("imc", "imc_cmd_start_char", "#")
...

1.3.6. outbound_proxy (str)

   The SIP address used as next hop when sending the message. Very
   useful when using OpenSIPS with a domain name not in DNS, or
   when using a separate OpenSIPS instance for imc processing. If
   not set, the message will be sent to the address in destination
   URI.

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.6. Set outbound_proxy parameter
...
modparam("imc", "outbound_proxy", "sip:opensips.org;transport=tcp")
...

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  imc_manager()

   Handles Message method.It detects if the body of the message is
   a conference command.If so it executes it, otherwise it sends
   the message to all the members in the room.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.7. Usage of imc_manager() function
...
# the rooms will be named chat-xyz to avoid overlapping
# with usernames
if(is_method("MESSAGE)
        && (uri=~ "sip:chat-[0-9]+@" || (uri=~ "sip:chat-manager@")
    imc_manager();
...

   Lists of the IM Conferencing rooms.

   Name: imc_list_rooms

   Parameters: none

   MI FIFO Command Format:
                :imc_list_rooms:_reply_fifo_file_
                _empty_line_

1.5.2.  imc_list_members

   Listing of the members in IM Conferencing rooms.

   Name: imc_list_members

   Parameters:
     * _room_ : the room for which you want to list the members

   MI FIFO Command Format:

1.6. Exported Statistics

1.6.1.  active_rooms

   Number of active IM Conferencing rooms.

1.7. IMC Commands

   A command is identified by the starting character. A command
   must be written in one line. By default, the starting character
   is '#'. You can change it via "imc_cmd_start_char" parameter.

   Next picture presents the list of commands and their
   parameters.

1.8. Installation

   Before running OpenSIPS with IMC, you have to setup the
   database tables where the module will store the data. For that,
   if the tables were not created by the installation script or
   you choose to install everything by yourself you can use the
   imc-create.sql SQL script in the database directories in the
   opensips/scripts folder as template. You can also find the
   complete database documentation on the project webpage,
   http://www.opensips.org/html/docs/db/db-schema-devel.html.
