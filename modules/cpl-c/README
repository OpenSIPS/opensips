Chapter 1. User's Guide

1.1. Overview

   cpl-c modules implements a CPL (Call Processing Language)
   interpreter. Support for uploading/downloading/removing
   scripts via SIP REGISTER method is present.
     _________________________________________________________

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. SER Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:

     * TM (Transaction) module- used for proxying/forking
       requests 
     * SL (StateLess) module - used for sending stateless reply
       when responding to REGISTER request or for sending back
       error responses 
     _________________________________________________________

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running SER with this module loaded:

     * libxml2 and libxml2-devel - on some SO, these to packages
       are merged into libxml2. This library contains an engine
       for XML parsing, DTD validation and DOM manipulation. 
     _________________________________________________________

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. cpl_db (string)

   A SQL URL have to be given to the module for knowing where the
   database containing the table with CPL scripts is locates. If
   required a user name and password can be specified for
   allowing the module to connect to the database server.

   This parameter is MANDATORY! 

   Example 1-1. Set cpl_db parameter
...
modparam("cpl_c","cpl_db","sql://user:passwd@host/database")
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.2. cpl_table (string)

   Indicates the name of the table that store the CPL scripts.
   This table must be locate into the database specified by
   "cpl_db" parameter. For more about the format of the CPL table
   please see modules/cpl-c/init.mysql.

   This parameter is MANDATORY! 

   Example 1-2. Set cpl_table parameter
...
modparam("cpl_c","cpl_table","cpltable")
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.3. cpl_dtd_file (string)

   Points to the DTD file describing the CPL grammar. The file
   name may include also the path to the file. This path can be
   absolute or relative (be careful the the path will be relative
   to the starting directory of SER).

   This parameter is MANDATORY! 

   Example 1-3. Set cpl_dtd_file parameter
...
modparam("cpl_c","cpl_dtd_file","/etc/ser/cpl-06.dtd")
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.4. log_dir (string)

   Points to a directory where should be created all the log file
   generated by the LOG CPL node. A log file per user will be
   created (on demand) having the name username.log.

   If this parameter is absent, the logging will be disabled
   without generating error on execution. 

   Example 1-4. Set log_dir parameter
...
modparam("cpl_c","log_dir","/var/log/ser/cpl")
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.3.5. proxy_recurse (int)

   Tells for how many time is allow to have recurse for PROXY CPL
   node If it has value 2, when doing proxy, only twice the proxy
   action will be re-triggered by a redirect response; the third
   time, the proxy execution will end by going on REDIRECTION
   branch. The recurse feature can be disable by setting this
   parameter to 0

   Default value of this parameter is 0. 

   Example 1-5. Set proxy_recurse parameter
...
modparam("cpl_c","proxy_recurse",2)
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1. cpl_run_script(type)

   Starts the execution of the CPL script. The user name is
   fetched from new_uri or requested uri or from To header -in
   this order- (for incoming execution) or from FROM header (for
   outgoing execution). As the function use TM module for several
   internal operation, it's a MUST to call prior it the
   t_newtran() to create a transaction for the current INVITE -
   also it's recommended for retransmission detection. Normally
   this function will end script execution. There is no guaranty
   that the CPL script interpretation ended when ser script ended
   also (for the same INVITE ;-)) - this can happen when the CPL
   script does a PROXY and the script interpretation pause after
   proxying and it will be resume when some reply is received
   (this can happen in a different process of SER). If the
   function returns to script, the SIP server should continue
   with the normal behavior as if no script existed. If error is
   returned (internally the function haven't sent any SIP error
   reply), the script should use a TM replying function for
   sending back to UAC the error reply.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:

     * type - which part of the script should be run; set it to
       "incoming" for having the incoming part of script executed
       (when an INVITE is received) or to "outgoing" for running
       the outgoing part of script (when a user is generating an
       INVITE - call).

   Example 1-6. cpl_run_script usage
...
cpl_run_script("incoming");
...

1.4.2. cpl_process_register()

   This function MUST be called only for REGISTER requests. It
   checks if the current REGISTER request is related or not with
   CPL script upload/download/ remove. If it is, all the needed
   operation will be done. For checking if the REGISTER is CPL
   related, the function looks fist to "Content-Type" header. If
   it exists and has a the mime type set to "application/cpl+xml"
   means this is a CPL script upload/remove operation. The
   distinction between to case is made by looking at
   "Content-Disposition" header; id its value is
   "script;action=store", means it's an upload; if it's
   "script;action=remove", means it's a remove operation; other
   values are considered to be errors. If no "Content-Type"
   header is present, the function looks to "Accept" header and
   if it contains the "*" or "application/cpl-xml" the request it
   will be consider one for downloading CPL scripts. The
   functions returns to script only if the the REGISTER is not
   related to CPL. In other case, the function will send by
   itself the necessary replies (stateless - using sl), including
   for errors.
