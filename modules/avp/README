AVP modules reads AVP values for usr_preferences table in SIP-DB.

use is as follows:
   avp_load("caller_uuid");

The parameter is either called_uuid or callee_uuid. It identifies
AVP which stores user's UUID. Then database is dipped with this
UUID.

If enabled in Makefile, avp module uses Radius as the source for
attribute/value pairs.  The following Radius specific module variables
are available:

radius_config (defaults to "/usr/local/etc/radiusclient/radiusclient.conf")
caller_service_type (defaults to "SIP-Caller-AVPs")
callee_service_type (defaults to "SIP-Callee-AVPs")

In Radius mode, avp_load function is called avp_load_radius and it takes
one parameter as follows:

avp_load_radius("caller") or
avp_load_radius("callee")

In the "caller" case, attributes of (digest) authenticated calling user
are loaded and in the "callee" case, attributes of the called user to
whom the Request-URI belongs to are loaded.

The module assumes that Radius returns the AVPs as values of reply
attribute SIP-AVP.  Its value is string of form "name:value" or of form
"name#value".  In the first case, value is interpreted as string and in
the second case as int (second case not implemented yet).
