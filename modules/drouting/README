Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

1.1.1. Introduction

   Dynamic Routing is a module for selecting (based on multiple
   criteria) the best gateway/destination to be used for
   delivering a certain call. Least Cost Routing (LCR) is a
   special case of dynamic routing - when the rules are ordered
   based on costs. Dynamic Routing comes with many features
   regarding routing rule selection:
     * prefix based
     * caller/group based
     * time based
     * priority based

   , processing :
     * stripping and prefixing
     * default rules
     * inbound and outbound processing
     * script route triggering

   and failure handling:
     * serial forking
     * weight based GW selection
     * random GW selection
     * GW probing for crashes

1.1.2. Features

   The dynamic routing implementation for OpenSIPS is designed
   with the following properties:
     * The routing info (destinations, carriers, rules, groups) is
       stored in a database and loaded into memory at start up
       time; reload at runtime via a Management Interface command.
     * weight-based or random selection of the destinations (from
       a rule or from a carrier), failure detection of gateways
       (with switching to next available gateway).
     * able to handle large volume of routing info (10M of rules)
       with minimal speed/time and memory consumption penalties
     * script integration - Pseudo-variable support in functions;
       scripting route triggering when rules are matched
     * bidirectional behavior - inbound and outbound processing
       (strip and prefixing when sending and receiving from a
       destination/GW)
     * blacklisting - the module allows definition of blacklists
       based on the destination IPs. This blacklists are to be
       used to prevent malicious forwarding to GWs (based on DNS
       lookups) when the script logic does none-GE forwarding
       (like foreign domains).
     * loading routing information from multiple databases - the
       gateways, rules, groups and carriers can be grouped by
       partitions, and each partition may be loaded from different
       databases/tables. This makes the routing process partition
       based. In order to be able to use a table from a partition,
       its name must be found in the "version" table belonging to
       the database defined in the partition's db_url.

1.1.3. Performance

   There were several tests performed regarding the performance of
   the module when dealing with a large number of routing rules.

   The tests were performed with a set of 383000 rules and
   measured:
     * time to load from DB
     * used shared memory

   The time to load was varying between 4 seconds and 8 seconds,
   depending of the caching of the DB client - the first load was
   the slowest (as the DB query hits the disk drive); the
   following are faster as data is already cached in the DB
   client. So technically speaking, the time to load (without the
   time to query which is DB type dependent) is ~4 seconds

   After loading the data into shared memory ~ 96M of memory were
   used exclusively for the DR data.

1.1.4. Dynamic Routing Concepts

   DR engine uses several concepts in order to define how the
   routing should be done (describing all the dependencies between
   destinations and routing rules).

1.1.4.1. Destination/Gateways

   These are the end SIP entities where actually the traffic needs
   to be sent after routing. They are stored in a table called
   “dr_gateways”. Gateway addresses are stored in a separate table
   because of the need to access them independent of Dynamic
   Routing processing (e.g., adding/ removing gateway PRI prefix
   before/after performing other operation -- receiving/relaying
   to gateway).

   In DR, a gateway is defined by:
     * id (string)
     * SIP address (SIP URI)
     * type (integer which allows GWs to be grouped by purpose,
       e.g. inbound, outbound, etc.)
     * strip value (number of digits) from dialled number
     * prefix (string) to be added to dialled number
     * attributes (not used by DR engine, but only pushed to
       script level when routing to this GW)
     * probing mode (how the GW should be probed at SIP level -
       see the probing chapter)

   The Gateways are to be used from the routing rule or from the
   carrier definition. They are all the time referred by their ID.

1.1.4.2. Carriers

   The carrier concept is used if you need to group gateways in
   order to have a better control on how the GWs will be used by
   DR rules; like in what order the GWs will be used.

   Basically, a carrier is a set of gateways which have its own
   sorting algorithm and its own attribute string. They are by
   default defined in the “dr_carriers” table.

   In DR, a carrier is defined by:
     * id (string)
     * list of gateways with/without weights (string)
       (Ex:“gw1=10,gw4=10” or “gw1,gw2”
     * flags : 0x1 - use weight for sorting the list and not
       definition order; 0x2 - use only the first gateway from the
       carrier (depending on the sorting); 0x4 - disable the usage
       of this carrier
     * attributes (not used by DR engine, but only pushed to
       script level when routing to this carrier)

   The Carriers are to be used only from the routing rule
   definition. They are all the time referred by their ID.

1.1.4.3. Routing Rules

   These are the actual rules which control the routing. Using
   different criterias (prefix, time, priority, etc), they will
   decide to which gateways the call will be sent.

   Default name for the table storing rule definitions is
   “dr_rules”.

   In DR, a routing rule is defined by:
     * group (list of numbers) - rules can be grouped (a rule may
       belong to multiple groups in the same time ) and you can
       use only a certain group at a point; like having a
       “premium” or “standard” or “interstate” or “intrastate”
       groups of rules to be used in different cases
     * prefix (string with digits only) - prefix to be used for
       matching this rule (longest prefix matching)
     * time validity (time recurrence string) - when this rule is
       valid from time point of view (see RFC 2445)
     * priority (number) - priority of the rule - higher value,
       higher priority (see rule section alg)
     * script route ID (string) - if defined, then execute the
       route with the specified ID when this rule is matched.
       That's it, a route which can be used to perform custom
       operations on message. NOTE that no modification is
       performed at signaling level and you must NOT do any
       signaling operations in that script route
     * list of GWs/carriers (string) - a comma separated list of
       gateways or carriers (defined by IDs) to be used for this
       rule; the carrier IDs are prefixed with “#” sign. For each
       ID (GW or carrier) you may specify a weight. For how this
       list will be interpreted (as order) see the rule selection
       section. Example of list: “gw1,gw4,#cr3” or
       “gw1=10,gw4=10,#cr3=80”
     * attributes (not used by DR engine, but only pushed to
       script level when this rule matched and been used)

   More on time recurrence:
     * A date-time expression that defines the time recurrence to
       be matched for current rule. Time recurrences are based
       closely on the recurring time intervals from the Internet
       Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
       (calendar COS), RFC 2445. The set of attributes used in
       routing rule specification is a subset of time recurrence
       attributes.
     * The value stored in database has the format of:
       <dtstart>|<duration>|<freq>|<until>|<interval>|<byday>|<bym
       onthday>|<byyearday>|<byweekno>|<bymonth>
     * When an attribute is not specified, the corresponding place
       must be left empty, whenever another attribute that follows
       in the list has to be specified.

1.1.5. Routing Rule Processing

   The module can be used to find out which is the best gateway to
   use for new calls terminated to PSTN. The algorithm to select
   the rule is as follows:
     * the module discovers the routing group of the originating
       user. This step is skipped if a routing group is passed
       from the script as parameter.
     * once the group is known, in the subset of the rules for
       this group the module looks for the one that matches the
       destination based on "prefix" column. The set of rules with
       the longest prefix is chosen. If no digit from the prefix
       matches, the default rules are used (rules with no prefix)
     * within the set of rules is applied the time criteria, and
       the rule which has the highest priority and matches the
       time criteria is selected to drive the routing.
     * Once found the rule, it may contain a route ID to execute.
       If a certain flag is set, then the processing is stopped
       after executing the route block.
     * The rule must contain a chain of gateways and carriers. The
       module will execute serial forking for each address in the
       chain (ordering is either done by simply using the
       definition order or it may weight-based - weight selection
       must be enabled). The next address in chain is used only if
       the previously has failed.
     * With the right gateway address found, the prefix (PRI) of
       the gateway is added to the request URI and then the
       request is forwarded.

   If no rule is found to match the selection criteria an default
   action must be taken (e.g., error response sent back). If the
   gateway in the chain has no prefix the request is forwarded
   without adding any prefix to the request URI.

1.1.6. Probing and Disabling destinations

   The module has the capability to monitor the status of the
   destinations by doing SIP probing (sending SIP requests like
   OPTIONS).

   For each destination, you can configure what kind of probing
   should be done (probe_mode column):
     * (0) - no probing at all;
     * (1) - probing only when the destination is in disabled mode
       (disabling via MI command will completely stop the probing
       also). The destination will be automatically re-enabled
       when the probing will succeed next time;
     * (2) - probing all the time. If disabled, the destination
       will be automatically re-enabled when the probing will
       succeed next time;

   A destination can become disabled in two ways:
     * script detection - by calling from script the dr_disable()
       function after trying the destination. In this case, if
       probing mode for the destination is (1) or (2), the
       destination will be automatically re-enabled when the
       probing will succeed.
     * MI command - by calling the dr_gw_status MI command for
       disabling (on demand) the destination. If so, the probing
       and re-enabling of this destination will be completly
       disabled until you re-enable it again via MI command - this
       is designed to allow controlled and complete disabling of
       some destination during maintenance.

   MI commands in parallel (with overlapping) Any new reload will
   be rejected (and discarded) while an existing reload is in
   progress.

   If you have a large routing set (millions of rules/prefixes),
   you should consider disabling concurrent reload as they will
   exhaust the shared memory (by reloading into memory, in the
   same time, multiple instances of routing data).

   Default value is “0 (disabled)”.

1.3.23. cluster_id (integer)

   The ID of the cluster the module is part of. The clustering
   support is used in drouting module for two purposes: for
   sharing the status of the gateways/carriers and for controlling
   the pinging to gateways.

   If clustering enbled, the module will automatically share
   changes over the status of the gateways/destinations/carriers
   with the other OpenSIPS instances that are part of a cluster.
   Whenever such a status changes (following an MI command, a
   probing result, a script command), the module will replicate
   this status change to all the nodes in this given cluster.

   The clustering with sharing tag support may be used to control
   which node in the cluster will perform the pinging/probing to
   gateways. See the cluster_sharing_tag option.

   For more info on how to define and populate a cluster (with
   OpenSIPS nodes) see the "clusterer" module.

   Default value is “0 (none)”.

   to control which node is responsible for perform the
   self-triggered actions in the module. Such actions may be the
   gateway probing or sharing the gateway/carrier status changes.
   If defined, only the node with active status of this tag will
   perform the actions (pinging and sharing status).

   The cluster_id must be defined for this option to work.

   This is an optional parameter. If not set, all the nodes in the
   cluster will individually do the probing and share the status
   changes.

   Default value is “empty (none)”.

   Example 1.24. Set cluster_sharing_tag parameter
...
# only the node with the active "vip" sharing tag will perform pinging

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  do_routing([groupID], [flags], [gw_whitelist],
[rule_attrs_pvar], [gw_attrs_pvar], [carrier_attrs_pvar],
[partition])

   Function to trigger routing of the message according to the
   rules in the database table and the configured parameters.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   If you set use_partitions to 1 the partition last parameter
   becomes mandatory.

   All parameters are optional. Any of them may be ignored,
   provided the necessary separation marks "," are properly
   placed.
     * groupID (int, optional) - number to specify the group of
       the caller for routing purposes. If none specified the
       function will automatically try to query the dr_group table
       to get this
     * flags (string, optional) - a list of letter-like flags for
       controlling the routing behavior. Possible flags are:
          + F - Enable rule fallback; normally the engine is using
            a single rule for routing a call; by setting this
            flag, the engine will fallback and use rules with less
            priority or shorter prefix when all the destination
            from the current rules failed.
          + L - Do strict length matching over the prefix -
            actually DR engine will do full number matching and
            not prefix matching anymore.
          + C - Only check if the dialed number matches any
            routing rule, without loading / applying any routing
            info (no GW is set, the RURI is not altered)
          + W (deprecated) - Instead of using the destination
            (from the rule definition) in the given order, sort
            them based on their weight.
            This flag is deprecated in 3.1+. The new approach is
            to set a "W" value as the "sort_alg" column of the
            dr_rules or dr_carriers tables. See the Dynamic
            Routing DB schema for more details.
     * gw_whitelist (string, optional) - a comma separated white
       list of gateways. This will force routing over, at most,
       this list of carriers or gateways (in other words, the
       whitelist will be intersected with the results of the
       search through the rules).
     * rule_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a writable variable which
       will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       dynamic routing rule.
     * gw_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a writable variable which
       will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       gateway.
     * carrier_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a a writable variable
       which will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       carrier.
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Besides
       specifing the name of one partition, you can use the "*"
       wildcard sign to force routing over all partitions.

   Example 1.35. do_routing usage
...
# all groups, sort on order, use_partitions is 0

...
# group id 0, sort on order, use_partitions is 0
do_routing(0);
...
# group id 0, sort on order, use_partitions is 1, route by partition nam
ed "part"
do_routing(0, , , , , , "part");
...
# group id from $var(id), sort on order, use_partitions is 0
do_routing($var(id));
...
# all groups, sort on weights, use_partitions is 0
do_routing(, "W");
...
# use_partitions is 1, partition and group supplied by AVPs, do strict l
ength matching
do_routing( $avp(grp),"L", , , , ,$avp(partition))

   If a new RURI is set, the used destination is removed from the
   pending set of alternative destinations.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   If you set use_partitions parameter to 1 you must supply the

          + 'p' (Prefix) - apply to the username of RURI the
            prefix defined by the GW
          + 'i' (Gateway ID) - return the gateway id into
            gw_id_avp AVP
          + 'n' (Ignore port) - ignores port number during
            matching
          + 'c' (Carrier ID) - return the carrier id into
            carrier_id_avp AVP
     * gw_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable variable
       which will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       gateway.
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Wildcard
       sign is accepted by this function.

   Example 1.40. is_from_gw usage
# use_partitions is not set
# match the source IP (only) against all gateways
if (is_from_gw(-1, "n")) {
        ...
}

# use_partitions is enabled
# match the source IP and port against all gateways from the "outbound"
# partition and return the matched gateway's carrier
if (is_from_gw(, "c", , "outbound")) {
        ...
}

1.4.7.  dr_is_gw( sip_uri, [type], [flag], [gw_attrs_pvar],
[partition])

   The function checks if the SIP URI hostname part stored inside
   the "src_pv" pseudo-variable is a gateway from a certain group.

   This function does not change anything in the message.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and ONREPLY_ROUTE.

   If you set use_partitions parameter to 1 you must supply the
   "partition" parameter to instruct on the partition where the
   gateway has been defined.

   It may take the following optional parameters:
     * sip_uri (string) - SIP URI. If the URI hostname part is a
       FQDN, it will be resolved prior to matching.
     * type (int, optional) - number for the GW/destination type
       to be checked; when omitting this parameter or specifying
       the special value -1, matching will be done against all
       types.
     * flags (string, optional) - letter like flags for
       controlling what operations should be performed when a GW
       matches:
          + 's' (Strip) - apply to the username of RURI the strip
            defined by the GW
          + 'p' (Prefix) - apply to the username of RURI the
            prefix defined by the GW
          + 'i' (Gateway ID) - return the gateway id into
            gw_id_avp AVP
          + 'n' (Ignore port) - ignores port number during
            matching
          + 'c' (Carrier ID) - return the carrier id into
            carrier_id_avp AVP
     * gw_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable variable
       which will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       gateway.
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Wildcard
       sign is accepted by this function.

   Example 1.41. dr_is_gw usage
# match the SIP URI host within $var(uac) against all gateways
if (dr_is_gw( $var(uac), , "n")) {
        ...
}


# match the SIP URI host within $var(uac) against
# all gws in "outbound" partition
if (dr_is_gw( $avp(uac), , "n", , "partition")) {
        ...
}

1.4.8.  dr_disable([partition])

   Marks as disabled the last destination that was used for the
   current call. The disabling done via this function will prevent
   the destination to be used for usage from now on. The probing
   mechanism can re-enable this peer (see the probing section in
   the beginning)

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   If you set use_partitions parameter to 1 you must supply the
   "partition" parameter to instruct on the partition where the
   gateway has been defined.

   It may take the following parameters:
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Wildcard
       sign is accepted by this function.

   Example 1.42. dr_disable() usage
...
if (t_check_status("(408)|(5[0-9][0-9])")) {
        dr_disable();

}
...
if (t_check_status("(408)|(5[0-9][0-9])")) {
        dr_disable("my_partition");

}
...

1.4.9.  dr_match([groupID], [flags], number, [rule_attrs_pvar],
[partition])

   The function tries to match/check the given number against the
   rules from the database.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   If you set use_partitions to 1 the partition last parameter
   becomes mandatory.

   The parameters are:
     * groupID (int) - number to specify the dr group (set of
       rules) to perform the check against
     * flags (string, optional) - a list of letter-like flags for
       controlling the checking/matching behavior. Possible flags
       are:
          + L - Do strict length matching over the prefix -
            actually DR engine will do full number matching and
            not prefix matching anymore.
     * rule_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a writable variable which
       will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       dynamic routing rule.
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on.

   Example 1.43. dr_match usage
...
if ( dr_match( 1, "L" , $fU, ,"dids") )
        xlog("Full From Username $fU found in group 1 partition DIDS\n")
;
...
if ( dr_match( 1, , $var(did) ) )
        xlog("DID $var(did) matches rules in group 1\n");
...
