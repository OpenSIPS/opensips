Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

1.1.1. Introduction

   Dynamic Routing is a module for selecting (based on multiple
   criteria) the best gateway/destination to be used for
   delivering a certain call. Least Cost Routing (LCR) is a
   special case of dynamic routing - when the rules are ordered
   based on costs. Dynamic Routing comes with many features
   regarding routing rule selection:
     * prefix based
     * caller/group based
     * time based
     * priority based

   , processing :
     * stripping and prefixing
     * default rules
     * inbound and outbound processing
     * script route triggering

   and failure handling:
     * serial forking
     * weight based GW selection
     * random GW selection
     * GW probing for crashes

1.1.2. Features

   The dynamic routing implementation for OpenSIPS is designed
   with the following properties:
     * The routing info (destinations, carriers, rules, groups) is
       stored in a database and loaded into memory at start up
       time; reload at runtime via a Management Interface command.
     * weight-based or random selection of the destinations (from
       a rule or from a carrier), failure detection of gateways
       (with switching to next available gateway).
     * able to handle large volume of routing info (10M of rules)
       with minimal speed/time and memory consumption penalties
     * script integration - Pseudo-variable support in functions;
       scripting route triggering when rules are matched
     * bidirectional behavior - inbound and outbound processing
       (strip and prefixing when sending and receiving from a
       destination/GW)
     * blacklisting - the module allows definition of blacklists
       based on the destination IPs. This blacklists are to be
       used to prevent malicious forwarding to GWs (based on DNS
       lookups) when the script logic does none-GE forwarding
       (like foreign domains).
     * loading routing information from multiple databases - the
       gateways, rules, groups and carriers can be grouped by
       partitions, and each partition may be loaded from different
       databases/tables. This makes the routing process partition
       based. In order to be able to use a table from a partition,
       its name must be found in the "version" table belonging to
       the database defined in the partition's db_url.

1.1.3. Performance

   There were several tests performed regarding the performance of
   the module when dealing with a large number of routing rules.

   The tests were performed with a set of 383000 rules and
   measured:
     * time to load from DB
     * used shared memory

   The time to load was varying between 4 seconds and 8 seconds,
   depending of the caching of the DB client - the first load was
   the slowest (as the DB query hits the disk drive); the
   following are faster as data is already cached in the DB
   client. So technically speaking, the time to load (without the
   time to query which is DB type dependent) is ~4 seconds

   After loading the data into shared memory ~ 96M of memory were
   used exclusively for the DR data.

1.1.4. Dynamic Routing Concepts

   DR engine uses several concepts in order to define how the
   routing should be done (describing all the dependencies between
   destinations and routing rules).

1.1.4.1. Destination/Gateways

   These are the end SIP entities where actually the traffic needs
   to be sent after routing. They are stored in a table called
   “dr_gateways”. Gateway addresses are stored in a separate table
   because of the need to access them independent of Dynamic
   Routing processing (e.g., adding/ removing gateway PRI prefix
   before/after performing other operation -- receiving/relaying
   to gateway).

   In DR, a gateway is defined by:
     * id (string)
     * SIP address (SIP URI)
     * type (integer which allows GWs to be grouped by purpose,
       e.g. inbound, outbound, etc.)
     * strip value (number of digits) from dialled number
     * prefix (string) to be added to dialled number
     * attributes (not used by DR engine, but only pushed to
       script level when routing to this GW)
     * probing mode (how the GW should be probed at SIP level -
       see the probing chapter)

   The Gateways are to be used from the routing rule or from the
   carrier definition. They are all the time referred by their ID.

1.1.4.2. Carriers

   The carrier concept is used if you need to group gateways in
   order to have a better control on how the GWs will be used by
   DR rules; like in what order the GWs will be used.

   Basically, a carrier is a set of gateways which have its own
   sorting algorithm and its own attribute string. They are by
   default defined in the “dr_carriers” table.

   In DR, a carrier is defined by:
     * id (string)
     * list of gateways with/without weights (string)
       (Ex:“gw1=10,gw4=10” or “gw1,gw2”
     * flags : 0x1 - use only the first gateway from the carrier
       (depending on the sorting); 0x2 - disable the usage of this
       carrier
     * sort algorithm : how the list of the gateways should be
       sorted before being used, NULL - use the DB given order, W
       - do weight based re-ordering, Q - do quality based sorting
       (requires the qrouting module)
     * attributes (not used by DR engine, but only pushed to
       script level when routing to this carrier)

   The Carriers are to be used only from the routing rule
   definition. They are all the time referred by their ID.

1.1.4.3. Routing Rules

   These are the actual rules which control the routing. Using
   different criterias (prefix, time, priority, etc), they will
   decide to which gateways the call will be sent.

   Default name for the table storing rule definitions is
   “dr_rules”.

   In DR, a routing rule is defined by:
     * group (list of numbers) - rules can be grouped (a rule may
       belong to multiple groups in the same time ) and you can
       use only a certain group at a point; like having a
       “premium” or “standard” or “interstate” or “intrastate”
       groups of rules to be used in different cases
     * prefix (string with digits only) - prefix to be used for
       matching this rule (longest prefix matching)
     * time validity (time recurrence string) - when this rule is
       valid from time point of view (see RFC 2445)
     * priority (number) - priority of the rule - higher value,
       higher priority (see rule section alg)
     * script route ID (string) - if defined, then execute the
       route with the specified ID when this rule is matched.
       That's it, a route which can be used to perform custom
       operations on message. NOTE that no modification is
       performed at signaling level and you must NOT do any
       signaling operations in that script route
     * list of GWs/carriers (string) - a comma separated list of
       gateways or carriers (defined by IDs) to be used for this
       rule; the carrier IDs are prefixed with “#” sign. For each
       ID (GW or carrier) you may specify a weight. For how this
       list will be interpreted (as order) see the rule selection
       section. Example of list: “gw1,gw4,#cr3” or
       “gw1=10,gw4=10,#cr3=80”
     * attributes (not used by DR engine, but only pushed to
       script level when this rule matched and been used)

   More on time recurrence:
     * A date-time expression that defines the time recurrence to
       be matched for current rule. Time recurrences are based
       closely on the recurring time intervals from the Internet
       Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification
       (calendar COS), RFC 2445. The set of attributes used in a
       routing rule specification is a subset of time recurrence
       attributes.
     * The value stored in database has the basic format of:
       <timezone>|<dtstart>|<dtend>|<duration>|<freq>|<until>|<int
       erval>|<byday>|<bymonthday>|<byyearday>|<byweekno>|<bymonth
       > , identical to the input of the check_time_rec() function
       of the cfgutils module, including the optional use of
       logical operators linking multiple such strings into a
       larger expression.
     * When an attribute is not specified, the corresponding place
       must be left empty, whenever another attribute that follows
       in the list has to be specified.

1.1.5. Routing Rule Processing

   The module can be used to find out which is the best gateway to
   use for new calls terminated to PSTN. The algorithm to select
   the rule is as follows:
     * the module discovers the routing group of the originating
       user. This step is skipped if a routing group is passed
       from the script as parameter.
     * once the group is known, in the subset of the rules for
       this group the module looks for the one that matches the
       destination based on "prefix" column. The set of rules with
       the longest prefix is chosen. If no digit from the prefix
       matches, the default rules are used (rules with no prefix)
     * within the set of rules is applied the time criteria, and
       the rule which has the highest priority and matches the
       time criteria is selected to drive the routing.
     * Once found the rule, it may contain a route ID to execute.
       If a certain flag is set, then the processing is stopped
       after executing the route block.
     * The rule must contain a chain of gateways and carriers. The
       module will execute serial forking for each address in the
       chain (ordering is either done by simply using the
       definition order or it may weight-based - weight selection
       must be enabled). The next address in chain is used only if
       the previously has failed.
     * With the right gateway address found, the prefix (PRI) of
       the gateway is added to the request URI and then the
       request is forwarded.

   If no rule is found to match the selection criteria an default
   action must be taken (e.g., error response sent back). If the
   gateway in the chain has no prefix the request is forwarded
   without adding any prefix to the request URI.

1.1.6. Probing and Disabling destinations

   The module has the capability to monitor the status of the
   destinations by doing SIP probing (sending SIP requests like
   OPTIONS).

   For each destination, you can configure what kind of probing
   should be done (probe_mode column):
     * (0) - no probing at all;
     * (1) - probing only when the destination is in disabled mode
       (disabling via MI command will completely stop the probing
       also). The destination will be automatically re-enabled
       when the probing will succeed next time;
     * (2) - probing all the time. If disabled, the destination
       will be automatically re-enabled when the probing will
       succeed next time;

   A destination can become disabled in two ways:
     * script detection - by calling from script the dr_disable()
       function after trying the destination. In this case, if
       probing mode for the destination is (1) or (2), the
       destination will be automatically re-enabled when the
       probing will succeed.
     * MI command - by calling the dr_gw_status MI command for
       disabling (on demand) the destination. If so, the probing
       and re-enabling of this destination will be completly
       disabled until you re-enable it again via MI command - this
       is designed to allow controlled and complete disabling of
       some destination during maintenance.

   MI commands in parallel (with overlapping) Any new reload will
   be rejected (and discarded) while an existing reload is in
   progress.

   If you have a large routing set (millions of rules/prefixes),
   you should consider disabling concurrent reload as they will
   exhaust the shared memory (by reloading into memory, in the
   same time, multiple instances of routing data).

   Default value is “0 (disabled)”.

   Example 1.17. Set no_concurrent_reload parameter
...

   multiple) for sending the probing messages from.

   For probing gateway the highest priority has socket from
   gateway configuration in dr_gateways table. Then socket from
   global probing_socket parameter and the lowest priority is
   default behaviour with auto selected socket wich OpenSIPS
   listens on.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.22. Set probing_socket parameter
...
modparam("drouting", "probing_socket", "udp:192.168.1.100:5060")
...

1.3.23. gw_socket_filter_mode (string)

   This parameter controls the gateway filtering during DB
   loading, or which gateways are loaded or not into memory
   depending on the configured socket they have.

   The supported filtering modes are:
     * "all" - all the gateways defined in DB are loaded into
       memory, disregarding what socket value they have. NOTE: for
       the gw sockets not matching any OpenSIPS listeners/sockets,
       the GW will be loaded with NULL/no socket.
     * "ignore" - all the gateways defined in DB are loaded into
       memory, but ignoring the socket value they have (the socket
       will be set to NULL/NONE with no attempt to check it
       against the OpenSIPS listeners/sockets).
     * "matched-only" - in this mode the module will load from DB
       only the gateways that have a configured a socket matching
       any of the the OpenSIPS listeners/sockets. If the gateways
       socket does not match, it will be discards, not loaded into
       memory at all.

   Default value is “"all"”.

   Example 1.23. Set gw_socket_filter_mode parameter
...
# multiple OpenSIPS instances sharing a DR setting, so each should
# load only the GWs they have sockets for.
modparam("drouting", "gw_socket_filter_mode", "matched-only")
...
# an OpenSIPs instance not doing routing, but needing to be
# aware of all the gws, so load them all ignoring the sockets
modparam("drouting", "gw_socket_filter_mode", "ignore")
...

1.3.24. cluster_id (integer)

   The ID of the cluster the module is part of. The clustering
   support is used in drouting module for two purposes: for
   sharing the status of the gateways/carriers and for controlling
   the pinging to gateways.

   If clustering enbled, the module will automatically share
   changes over the status of the gateways/destinations/carriers
   with the other OpenSIPS instances that are part of a cluster.
   Whenever such a status changes (following an MI command, a
   probing result, a script command), the module will replicate
   this status change to all the nodes in this given cluster.

   The clustering with sharing tag support may be used to control
   which node in the cluster will perform the pinging/probing to
   gateways. See the cluster_sharing_tag option.

   For more info on how to define and populate a cluster (with
   OpenSIPS nodes) see the "clusterer" module.

   Default value is “0 (none)”.

   Example 1.24. Set cluster_id parameter
...
# replicate gw/carrier status with all OpenSIPS in cluster ID 9
modparam("drouting", "cluster_id", 9)
...

1.3.25. cluster_sharing_tag (string)

   The name of the sharing tag (as defined per clusterer modules)
   to control which node is responsible for perform the
   self-triggered actions in the module. Such actions may be the
   gateway probing (see also the cluster_probing_mode parameter)
   or sharing the gateway/carrier status changes. If defined, only
   the node with active status of this tag will perform the
   actions (pinging and sharing status).

   The cluster_id must be defined for this option to work.

   This is an optional parameter. If not set, all the nodes in the
   cluster will share the status changes.

   Default value is “empty (none)”.

   Example 1.25. Set cluster_sharing_tag parameter
...
# only the node with the active "vip" sharing tag will perform pinging
# and broadcast the status changes
modparam("drouting", "cluster_id", 9)
modparam("drouting", "cluster_sharing_tag", "vip")
...

1.3.26. cluster_probing_mode (string)

   This paramter controls how the probing/pinging should be done
   when using the clustering support. It is about which node in
   the cluster pings which gateway/destination.

   The cluster_id must be defined for this option to work.

   The supported probing modes are:
     * "all" - all the nodes in the cluster will independetly ping
       all the defined gateways, an "all" pings "all" mode.
     * "by-shtag" - all the gateways are pinged by only one node
       in the cluster, the node having the cluster_sharing_tag
       active. By activating the sharing tag on a different node,
       the pinging duty will be transfered to another node in the
       cluster.
     * "distributed" - the pinging effort is distributed across
       all the nodes in the cluster, so each node will ping a
       sub-set of the overall set of gateway. Still all the
       gateways will get pinged (and only once per pinging cycle).
       The re-partitioning of the pinging effort over the
       available nodes in the cluster is automatically done when
       new nodes are joining or nodes are dropping out. Still
       there is no guaratee on which node will be responsible for
       pinging which gateway.

   Default value is “"all"”.

   Example 1.26. Set cluster_probing_mode parameter
...
# only the node with the active "vip" sharing tag will perform pinging
modparam("drouting", "cluster_id", 9)
modparam("drouting", "cluster_sharing_tag", "vip")
modparam("drouting", "cluster_probing_mode", "by-shtag")
...
# the pinging effort is distributed across all the nodes

...
modparam("drouting", "use_partitions", 1)
...

1.3.32. db_partitions_url (str)

   The url to the database containing partition-specific
   information. (partition-specific information includes partition
   name, url to the database where information about the partition

...

1.3.35. enable_restart_persistency (int)

   Parameter set to enable restart persistency for the Dynamic
   Routing module. When this parameter is set, the drouting module
   no longer loads the data from the database after restart, but
   uses the persistent storage file, and loads data from it “on
   demand”, improving the startup performance.

   NOTE: If the restart persistent cache is not populated from a
   previous run, then the data will be loaded from database at
   startup!

   NOTE: A reload will update the cached data.

   Default value is “0 (disabled)”.

   Example 1.35. Set enable_restart_persistency parameter
...
modparam("drouting", "enable_restart_persistency", yes)
...

   set of dr_rules-compatible table names, to be each loaded and
   then merged into a single "dr_rules" table, for any given
   partition.

   The syntax of the parameter is: "token : query", where token is
   a special name given to a "dr_rules" table, so OpenSIPS can
   match it against the custom queries defined using this
   parameter.

   This parameter may be set multiple times (each definition
   creates a new mapping).

   Example 1.38. Set the rule_tables_query parameter
...

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  do_routing([groupID], [flags], [gw_whitelist],
[rule_attrs_pvar], [gw_attrs_pvar], [carrier_attrs_pvar],
[partition])

   Function to trigger routing of the message according to the
   rules in the database table and the configured parameters.

   This function can be used from all routes.

   If you set use_partitions to 1 the partition last parameter
   becomes mandatory.

   All parameters are optional. Any of them may be ignored,
   provided the necessary separation marks "," are properly
   placed.
     * groupID (int, optional) - number to specify the group of
       the caller for routing purposes. If none specified the
       function will automatically try to query the dr_group table
       to get this
     * flags (string, optional) - a list of letter-like flags for
       controlling the routing behavior. Possible flags are:
          + F - Enable rule fallback; normally the engine is using
            a single rule for routing a call; by setting this
            flag, the engine will fallback and use rules with less
            priority or shorter prefix when all the destination
            from the current rules failed.
          + L - Do strict length matching over the prefix -
            actually DR engine will do full number matching and
            not prefix matching anymore.
          + C - Only check if the dialed number matches any
            routing rule, without loading / applying any routing
            info (no GW is set, the RURI is not altered)
     * gw_whitelist (string, optional) - a comma separated white
       list of gateways. This will force routing over, at most,
       this list of carriers or gateways (in other words, the
       whitelist will be intersected with the results of the
       search through the rules).
     * rule_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a writable variable which
       will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       dynamic routing rule.
     * gw_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a writable variable which
       will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       gateway.
     * carrier_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - a a writable variable
       which will be populated with the attributes of the matched
       carrier.
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Besides
       specifing the name of one partition, you can use the "*"
       wildcard sign to force routing over all partitions.

   Example 1.39. do_routing usage
...
# all groups, sort on order, use_partitions is 0
do_routing();
...
# all groups, sort on order, use_partitions is 1, route by partition nam

...
# group id 0, sort on order, use_partitions is 0
do_routing(0);
...
# group id 0, sort on order, use_partitions is 1, route by partition nam
ed "part"
do_routing(0, , , , , , "part");
...
# group id from $var(id), sort on order, use_partitions is 0
do_routing($var(id));
...
# all groups, sort on weights, use_partitions is 0
do_routing(, "W");
...
# use_partitions is 1, partition and group supplied by AVPs, do strict l
ength matching
do_routing( $avp(grp),"L", , , , ,$avp(partition))
...
# group id 2, sort on order, fallback rule and also return the gateway a
ttributes
do_routing(2, "F", , , $var(gw_attributes));
...

1.4.2.  route_to_carrier( carriers, [gw_attrs_pvar],
[carrier_attrs_pvar], [partition])

   Function to trigger the direct routing to a given set carriers
   (one or more). So, the routing is not done prefix based, but
   carrier based (call will be sent to the GWs of that carrier,
   based on carrier policy).

   This function can be used from all routes.

   If you set use_partitions parameter to 1 you must supply the
   "partition" parameter also (where the carrier are to be found).

     * carriers (string) - comma separated carrier IDs (names)
     * gw_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable variable
       which will be populated with the attributes of the
       currently matched gateway of this carrier.
     * carrier_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable
       variable which will be populated with the attributes of
       this carrier.
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Wildcard
       sign is not accepted by the function.

        t_relay();
        exit;
}
...
# use_partitions is enabled
if ( route_to_carrier($var(carrierId), , , $var(my_partition)) ) {
        xlog("Routing to \"my_top_carrier\"\n");

        t_relay();
        exit;
}
...

1.4.3.  route_to_gw(gw_id, [gw_attrs_var], [carrier_attrs_var],
[partition])

   Function to trigger the direct routing to a given gateway (or
   list of gateways). Attributes and per-gw processing will be
   available.

   This function can be used from all routes.

   If you set use_partitions parameter to 1 you must supply the
   "partition" parameter to instruct on the partition where the
   gateway has been defined.

     * gw_id (string) - comma separated list of gateway IDs to be
       used.
     * gw_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable variable
       which will be populated with the attributes of the
       currently matched gateway.
     * carrier_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable
       variable which will be populated with the attributes of
       this carrier. NOTE: the first carrier pointing to the GW(s)
       will be considered!
     * partition (string, optional) - the name of the DR partition
       to be used. This parameter is to be defined ONLY if the
       "use_partition" module parameter is turned on. Wildcard
       sign is not accepted by the function.

   Example 1.41. route_to_gw usage
...
# use_partitions is not set
if ( route_to_gw("gw_europe") ) {
        t_relay();
        exit;
}
...
# use_partitions is not set
if ( route_to_gw("gw1,gw2,gw3", $var(gw_attrs)) ) {

}
...

1.4.4.  use_next_gw( [rule_attrs_pvar], [gw_attrs_pvar],
[carrier_attrs_pvar], [partition])

   The function takes the next available destination (set by
   do_routing, as alternative destinations) and pushes it into the
   RURI. Note that the function just sets the RURI (nothing more).

   If a new RURI is set, the used destination is removed from the
   pending set of alternative destinations.

   "partition" parameter to instruct on the partition where the
   gateway has been defined.

   The function returns true only if a new RURI was set. False is
   returned is no other alternative destinations are found or in
   case of an internal processing error. It may take the following
   optional parameters:
     * rule_attrs_pvar (var, optional) - an output writable
       variable which will be populated with the attributes of the

1.6. Exported Events

1.6.1.  E_DROUTING_STATUS

   This event is raised when the module changes the state of a
   gateway, either through an MI command, probing or script
   function.

   Parameters:
     * partition - the name of the partition.
     * gwid - the gateway identifier.
     * address - the address of the gateway.
     * status - disabled MI if the gateway was disabled using MI
       commands, probing if the gateway is being pinged, inactive
       if it was disabled from the script or active if the gateway
       is enabled.

1.7. Exported Status/Report Identifiers

   The module provides the "drouting" Status/Report group, where
   each routing partition is defined as a separate SR identifier.

1.7.1. [partition_name]

   The status of these identifiers reflects the readiness/status
   of the cached data (if available or not when being loaded from
   DB):
     * -2 - no data at all (initial status)
     * -1 - no data, initial loading in progress
     * 1 - data loaded, partition ready
     * 2 - data available, a reload in progress

   Reload reporting:

   In terms of data reloading, the following logs will be
   reported:
     * starting DB data loading
     * DB data loading failed, discarding
     * DB data loading successfully completed
     * N gateways loaded (N discarded), N carriers loaded (N
       discarded), N rules loaded (N discarded)

ed (0 discarded), 1 rules loaded (0 discarded)"
            }
        ]
    }

1.7.2. [partition_name];events

   GW/Carrier switching reporting:

   For reporting events related to the state changes of the
   gateways and carriers, the module provides separate identifiers
   (still one per partition). Why separate ones? The reports on
   state changing may be verbose and there is the risk of
   loose/discard important reports on reloads due to the high
   number of logs on state changes;

   So, each partition will provide the identified
   "partition_name;events" for reporting state changes of gateways
   and carriers, along with the reason of the change. This
   identifiers have a 200 records history before discarding the
   old ones.

1.8. Installation

   The module requires 4 tables in the OpenSIPS database:
   dr_groups, dr_gateways, dr_carriers, dr_rules. The SQL syntax
   to create them can be found in the drouting-create.sql script,
   located in the database directories of the opensips/scripts
   folder. You can also find the complete database documentation
   on the project webpage,
   https://opensips.org/docs/db/db-schema-devel.html.

   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".
