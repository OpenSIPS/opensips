1.1. Overview

   This module implements message compression/decompression and
   base64 encoding for sip messages using deflate and gzip
   algorithm/headers. Another feature of this module is reducing
   headers to compact for as specified in SIP RFC's, sdp body
   codec unnecessary description removal (for codecs 0-97),
   whitelist for headers not be removed (excepting necessary
   headers).

1.2. How it works

   The module is using zlib library to implement compression and
   base64 encoding for converting the message to human readable
   characters. It also uses callbacks to do the
   compression/compaction of the message in order for this
   operations to be done after all the other script functions have
   been applied to the message.

1.3. Usage cases

   As we know, udp fragmentation is a big problem these days, so
   this module comes to try making the message smaller by any
   means. The module can be used to compress the body or some
   headers found in the message or it can decompress compressed
   messages. There are more possibilities to do this: the body can
   be compressed along with the specified headers or the headers
   can be compressed isolated from the body in a specific header.

   Also the module does message compaction: reduction of sip
   header names to short form (for example "Via" becomes 'v' and
   so on), sdp body codec attributes unnecesary description
   ("a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000" becomes "a=rtpmap:0"), unwanted headers
   removal by specfing the ones you want to keep in a whitelist.

   The module also does message decompresion and base64 decoding.
   It can detect the algorithm used for compression from the
   Content-Encoding header. At this moment only gzip and deflate
   algorithms are supported.

1.4. Dependencies

1.4.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None

1.5. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * zlib-dev - the development libraries of zlib.

1.6. Exported Parameters

1.6.1. mc_level (int)

   This parameter ranges from 1 to 9 and it specifies the level of
   compression you want to do. Default is 6. 9 is the best, but
   the longest time consuming algorithm and 1 is the worst. If, by
   mistake, you set a lower or a higher level, the default, 6,
   will be used, but you will receive a warning.

   Example 1.1.  Set mc_level parameter
...
modparam("mc", "mc_level", "3")
...

1.7. Exported Functions

1.7.1.  mc_compress([algo], flags, [whitelist])

   This function will compress the current message as specified in
   the parameters. Keep in mind that the compression is done just
   before the message is sent, so that all your lumps can be
   applied.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * algo - The algorithm used for compression. Currently
       implemented are deflate ('0') and gzip ('1'). The algo
       parameter can have the following types:
          + integer - the compression algorithm is statically
            assigned
          + pvar - the compression algorithm is the value of an
            existing pseudo-variable (as integer value)
     * flags - Specifies on what to apply the compression and
       where to put the result of the compression. The flags
       parameter can have the following types:
          + string - the flags parameter is statically assigned
          + pvar - the flags parameter is the value of an existing
            pseudo-variable (as string value)
       The flags parameter can have the following values:
          + “b” - specifies that the body of the message shall be
            compressed. Notice that if the message has no body,
            the flag will have no effect.
          + “h” - specifies that all the headers, except the
            mandatory ones (which will be specified in "whitelist"
            parameter section) and the ones in the whitelist shall
            be compressed.
          + “s” - the headers and the body shall be compressed
            Separately, meaning that a new header named
            "Comp-Hdrs" will be created, and this header will keep
            the content of the compressed headers. Also,
            "Headers-Encoding" header will be created in order to
            keep the algorithm used to compress the headers. If
            this flag is not specified, the headers and the body
            (if 'b' and 'h' flags are specified) will be
            compressed alltogether in the new body of the message.
          + “e” - specify that you want base64 Encoding. If you do
            not specify this flag, by default the module will send
            the raw compressed message in deflate/gzip format.
     * whitelist - header names list, separated by '|' which will
       specify which headers shall not be compressed, along with
       the mandatory ones, which can never be compressed. The
       mandatory headers are the following: VIA, FROM, TO, CSEQ,
       ROUTE, RECORD_ROUTE, CALLID. Also, CONTENT_TYPE is
       mandatory only if CONTENT-LENGTH > 0. Also, in case you do
       not want to use body compression, the Content-Length header
       will become a mandatory header, which can not be
       compressed. In case you do want body compression, the old
       Content-Length Header will be compressed, and a new content
       length will be calculated. When you will want to do
       decompression, the compressed length will be removed, and
       the content length header will be the same as the one
       before the compression.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, LOCAL_ROUTE,
   FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.2. mc_compress usage
...
if (!mc_compress("0", "bhs", "Max-Forwards|Subject|P-Asserted-Identity")
)
        xlog("compression failed\n");
...

   Example 1.3. mc_compress usage
...
$avp(algo) = "1";
$var(flags) = "bs";
$var(list) = "Max-Forwards | Contact";
mc_compres("$avp(algo", "$var(flags", "$var(list");
xlog("compression registered\n");
...

1.7.2.  mc_compact([whitelist])

   This function will realise four different things: headers which
   are not mandatory and are not in the whitelist will be removed,
   headers of same type will be put together, separated by ',',
   header names which have a short form will be reduced to that
   short form and sdp rtpmap attribute headers which contain a
   value lower than 98 will be removed, because it is no longer
   needed. No lumps affected by this function, because it is
   applied after almost all the processing is done. The mc_compact
   supported short forms are:
     * “c” - Content-Type (RFC 3261)
     * “f” - From (RFC 3261)
     * “i” - Call-ID (RFC 3261)
     * “k” - Supported (RFC 3261)
     * “l” - Content-Length (RFC 3261)
     * “m” - Contact (RFC 3261)
     * “s” - Subject (RFC 3261)
     * “t” - To (RFC 3261)
     * “v” - Via (RFC 3261)
     * “x” - Session-Expires (RFC 4028)

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * whitelist - Whitelist of headers not to be removed, except
       from the mandatory ones. The whitelist header names must pe
       separated by '|'. The algo parameter can have the following
       types:
          + string - the whitelist is statically assigned
          + pvar - the whitelist is the value of an existing
            pseudo-variable (as integer value)

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, LOCAL_ROUTE,
   FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.4. mc_compress usage
...
if (!mc_compact("Max-Forwards|P-Asserted-Identity"))
        xlog("compaction failed\n");
...

1.7.3.  mc_decompress()

   This function does the reverse of mc_compress, meaning that it
   does base64 decoding and gzip/deflate decompression. Keep in
   mind that gzip decompression is a little bit more efficient
   because it is being known the size of the compressed buffer as
   against deflate which does not hold the size of the buffer, so
   the decompression will be made in a static buffer.

   This function requests no parameters.

   WARNING: This function replaces the original buffer of the
   message with the decompressed buffer, so any processing you do
   to the message will not be taken into consideration. Try
   applying the decompression function, before you do any other
   processing to the message.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, LOCAL_ROUTE,
   FAILURE_ROUTE.

   Example 1.5. mc_decompress usage
...
if (!mc_decompress())
        xlog("decompression failed\n");
...

1.8. Compression performance test for sip messages

   The following results have been obtained using the compression
   function included in the module. Using this results, you can
   improve the usage of this module, in order to compress only
   when you think it is favorable enough for you. The algorithm
   used is deflate for all cases because gzip is always 16 bytes
   higher than deflate, which represents the uncompressed size
   modulo 4GB. For the subtests in the same test, the same SIP
   message have been used.
