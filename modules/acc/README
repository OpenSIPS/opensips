Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The ACC module is used to account transaction information to
   different backends such as syslog, SQL, AAA.

   To account a transaction and to choose which set of backends to
   be used, the script writer only has to mark the transaction for
   accounting by using the do_accounting() script function. Note
   that the function is not actually doing the accounting at that
   very time, it is just setting a marker - the actual accounting
   will be done later when the transaction or dialog will be
   completed.

   Even so, the module allows the script writer to force
   accounting on the spot in special cases via some other script
   functions.

   The accounting module will log by default a fixed set of
   attributes for the transaction - if you customize your
   accounting by adding more information to be logged, please see
   the next chapter about extra accounting - Section 1.2, “Extra
   accounting”.

   The fixed minimal accounting information is:
     * Request Method name
     * From header TAG parameter
     * To header TAG parameter
     * Call-Id
     * 3-digit Status code from final reply
     * Reason phrase from final reply
     * Timestamp when transaction was completed

   If a value is not present in the request, the empty string is
   accounted instead.

   Note that:
     * A single INVITE may produce multiple accounting reports --
       that's most likely due to the SIP forking feature.
     * Since version 2.2, all flags used for accounting have been
       replaced with the do_accounting() function. No need to
       worry anymore whether you have set the flags or not, or be
       confused by various flag names, now you only have to call
       the function and it will do all the work for you.
     * OpenSIPS now supports session/dialog accounting. It can
       automatically correlate INVITEs with BYEs for generating
       proper CDRs, for example for billing purposes.
     * If a UA fails in the middle of a conversation, a proxy will
       never find out about it. In general, a better practice is
       to account from an end-device (such as PSTN gateway), which
       best knows about call status (including media status and
       PSTN status in case of the gateway).

   The SQL, Event Interface and AAA backend support are compiled
   in the module.

   A very comprehensive description of how the accounting module
   works in terms accounting scope, accounting events and
   accounting backends can be found in this online Advanced
   Accounting Tutorial.

1.1.1. General Example

loadmodule "modules/acc/acc.so"

if ($ru=~"sip:+40") /* calls to Romania */ {
    if (!proxy_authorize("sip_domain.net" /* realm */,
    "subscriber" /* table name */))  {
        proxy_challenge("sip_domain.net" /* realm */, "0" /* no qop */ )
;
        exit;
    }

    if (is_method("INVITE") && $au!=$fU) {
        xlog("FROM URI != digest username\n");
        sl_send_reply("403","Forbidden");
    }

    do_accounting("log"); /* set for accounting via syslog */
    t_relay(); /* enter stateful mode now */
};

1.2. Extra accounting

1.2.1. Overview

   Along the static default information, the ACC module allows
   dynamic selection of extra information to be logged using the
   acc_extra pseudovariable. This allows you to log any
   pseudo-variable (AVPs, parts of the request, parts of the
   reply, etc).

1.2.2. Definitions and syntax

   Selection of extra information is done via extra_field
   parameter by specifying tags and log_names for the additional
   information. This information is defined via acc_extra
   pseudovariable, referenced with the define tag. If the tag is
   not specified, its value will be considered to be the same as
   the log_value. Accounting backend(log, db, aaa, evi) is
   specified at the beginning of the definition, separated by ':'
   from the rest. The syntax of the parameter is:
     * backend : tag -> log_name (';'tag -> log_name)*
     * backend : tag (';' tag)*

   Extra values are consistent during the whole call. Setting a
   value during a request, will cause it to remain visible during
   all replies. Also, concerning CDR logging, setting a value on
   the initial INVITE will result in having that value throughout
   the dialog.

   Via log_name you define how/where the data will be logged. Its
   meaning depends of the accounting support which is used:
     * LOG accounting - log_name will be just printed along with
       the data in log_name=data format;
     * DB accounting - log_name will be the name of the DB column
       where the data will be stored.IMPORTANT: add in db acc
       table the columns corresponding to each extra data;
     * AAA accounting - log_name will be the AVP name used for
       packing the data into AAA message. The log_name will be
       translated to AVP number via the dictionary. IMPORTANT: add
       in AAA dictionary the log_name attribute.
     * Events accounting - log_name will be the name of the
       parameter in the event raised.

1.2.3. How it works

   Declaring an extra in the format of
modparam("acc", "extra_fields", "log: a -> test_a")

   will enable you to set the value for test_a field of the log
   only by setting $acc_extra(a) variable. Otherwise, the field
   shall be logged with no value(null).

1.2.4. Radius accounting dependencies

   If radius accounting is used, except from a radius client
   library which is mandatory, dictionary.rfc2866 must be included
   for the module to work properly.

1.3. Multi Call-Legs accounting

1.3.1. Overview

   A SIP call can have multiple legs due forwarding actions. For
   example user A calls user B which forwards the call to user C.
   There is only one SIP call but with 2 legs ( A to B and B to
   C). Accounting the legs of a call is required for proper
   billing of the calls (if C is a PSTN number and the call is
   billed, user B must pay for the call - as last party modifing
   the call destination-, and not A - as initiator of the call.
   Call forwarding on server is only one example which shows the
   necessity of the having an accounting engine with multiple legs
   support.

1.3.2. Configuration

   First how it works: The idea is to have a variable to store a
   set of values for each leg. The meaning of the variable content
   is strictly decided by the script writer - it can be the origin
   and source of the leg, its status or any other related
   information. By default there is defined only one leg. Script
   writer has to decide when is the time to create a new leg, by
   using acc_new_leg() script function. When creating a new leg,
   all the values for that leg will be set to NULL by default.

   When the accounting information for the call will be
   written/sent, all the call-leg pairs will be added.

   By default, the multiple call-leg support is disabled - it can
   be enabled just by setting acc_leg variable leg_fields module
   parameter. Note that the last one only makes sense only for
   CDRs that are generated automatically by OpenSIPS.

1.3.3. Logged data

   For each call, all the values from the acc_leg variable will be
   logged. How the information will be actually logged, depends of
   the data backend:
     * syslog -- all leg-sets will be added to one record string
       as acc_leg(leg1)=xxx, acc_leg(leg2)=xxxx ,... sets.
     * database -- each pair will be separately logged (due DB
       data structure constraints); several records will be
       written, the difference between them being only the fields
       corresponding to the call-leg info.

Note
       You will need to add in your DB (all acc related tables)
       the colums for call-leg info (a column for each leg value
       of the set).
     * AAA -- all sets will be added to the same AAA accounting
       message as AAA AVPs - for each call-leg a set of AAA AVPs
       will be added (corresponding to the per-leg set)

Note
       You will need to add in your dictionary the AAA AVPs used
       in call-leg set definition.
     * events -- each pair will appear as a different
       parameter-value pair in the event. Similar to the database
       behavior, multiple events will be raised, and the only
       difference between them is the leg information.

   Important!!! In order to use RADIUS, one must include the AVPs
   which are located in
   $(opensips_install_dir)/etc/dictionary.opensips, both in
   opensips radius config script dictionary and radius server
   dictionary. Most important are the last three AVPs (IDs : 227,
   228, 229) which you won't find in any SIP dictionary (at least
   at this moment) because they are only used in openSips.

1.4. CDRs accounting

1.4.1. Overview

   ACC module can now also maintain session/dialog accounting.
   This allows you to log useful information like call duration,
   call start time and setup time.

1.4.2. Configuration

   In order to have CDRs accounting, first you need to set the cdr
   flag when calling do_accounting() script function for the
   initial INVITE of the dialog.

1.4.3. How it works

   This type of accounting is based on the dialog module. When an
   initial INVITE is received, if the cdr flag is set, then the
   dialog creation time is saved. Once the call is answered and
   the ACK is received, other information like extra values or leg
   values are saved. When the corresponding BYE is received, the
   call duration is computed and all information is stored to the
   desired backend.

1.5. Dependencies

1.5.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other words
   the listed modules must be loaded before this module):
     * tm -- Transaction Manager
     * a database module -- If SQL support is used.
     * rr -- Record Route, if “detect_direction” module parameter
       is enabled.
     * an aaa module
     * dialog -- Dialog, if “cdr” option is used

1.5.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none.

1.6. Exported Parameters

# if setting $acc_extra(b) you will see "b=<value> in logs
modparam("acc", "extra_fields", "log: a->My_a_Field; b")
# for mysql-based accounting, use the names of the columns
# $acc_extra(a) = <value>  results in setting col_a with <value> in db

1.7. Exported Pseudo-Variables

1.7.1. $acc_extra(tag_name)

   This variable can addresed with the tag names defined using
   extra_fields. If do_accounting() isn't called, this variable is
   visible during the whole processing of one message, enabling
   calling acc_XXX_request(). If do_accounting() is called, the
   variable will be visible from the first call of this function
   until the actual accounting is being made.

1.7.2. $(acc_leg(tag_name)[leg_index])

   This variable can be addressed with the tag names defined using
   leg_fields and a valid leg index (<= $acc_current_leg). This
   variable cannot be used unless do_accounting() is used. The
   variable also accepts negative indexes, which start from -1
   (the lastly added leg).

# the "caller" value of the current leg
$acc_leg(caller)

# the "caller" value of the lastly added leg
$(acc_leg(caller)[-1]) # equivalent to $acc_leg(caller)
                       # equivalent to $(acc_leg(caller)[$acc_current_le
g])

# the "caller" value of the next-to-last leg
$(acc_leg(caller)[-2])


1.7.3. $acc_current_leg (read-only)

   Holds the index of the current leg, starting from 0. Calling
   acc_new_leg() will increment this index.

1.8. Exported Functions

1.8.1.  do_accounting(type, [flags], [table])

   do_accounting() replaces all the *_flag and, *_missed_flag,
   cdr_flag, failed transaction_flag and the db_table_avp
   modparams. Just call do_accounting(), select where and how you
   want the accounting to take place, and the function will do all
   the work for you.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * type (string) - the type of accounting you want to do. All
       types have to be separated by '|'. The following parameters
       can be used:
          + log - syslog accounting;
          + db - database accounting;
          + aaa - aaa specific accounting;
          + evi - Event Interface accounting;
     * flags (string, optional) - flags for the accounting type
       you have selected. All the types have to be separated by
       '|'. The following parameters can be used:
          + cdr - enables dialog-level accounting. OpenSIPS will
            internally detect dialog termination
            (generation/receipt of a BYE request), and store the
            CDR as soon as the BYE request is replied to. By
            enabling the "cdr" flag, the following additional
            fields will be populated: duration, ms_duration,
            setuptime, created. (requires dialog module support)
          + missed - log missed calls; take care that this flag
            will be deactivated after the first missed call; you
            will have to reactivate it in the failure_route if you
            want to account each destination that did not respond
            to the call;
          + failed - flag which indicates if the transaction
            should also be accounted in case of failure
            (status>=300);
     * table (string, optional) - table where to do the
       accounting; it replaces old table_avp parameter;

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.21. do_accounting usage
                ...
                if (!has_totag()) {
                        if (is_method("INVITE")) {
                        /* enable cdr and missed calls accounting in the
 database
                         * and to syslog; db accounting shall be done in
 "my_acc" table */
                                do_accounting("db|log", "cdr|missed", "m
y_acc");
                        }
                }
                ...
                if (is_method("BYE")) {
                        /* do normal accounting via aaa */
                        do_accounting("aaa");
                }
                ...

1.8.2.  drop_accounting([type], [flags])

   drop_accounting() resets flags and types of accounting set with
   do_accounting(). If called with no arguments all accounting
   will be stopped. If called with only one argument all
   accounting for that type will be stopped. If called with two
   arguments normal accounting will still be enabled.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * type (string, optional) - the type of accounting you want
       to stop. All the types have to be separated by '|'. The
       following parameters can be used:
          + log - stop syslog accounting;
          + db - stop database accounting;
          + aaa - stop aaa specific accounting;
          + evi - stop Event Interface accounting;
     * flags (string, optional) - flags to be reset for the
       accouting type you have selected. All the types have to be
       separated by '|'. The following parameters can be used:
          + cdr - stop CDR accounting;
          + missed - stop logging missed calls;
          + failed - stop failed transaction accounting;

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.22. drop_accounting usage
                ...
                acc_log_request("403 Destination not allowed");
                if (!has_totag()) {
                        if (is_method("INVITE")) {
                        /* enable cdr and missed calls accounting in the
 database
                         * and to syslog; db accounting shall be done in
 "my_acc" table */
                                do_accounting("db|log", "cdr|missed", "m
y_acc");
                        }
                }
                ...
                /* later in your script */
                if (...) { /* you don't want accounting anymore */
                        /* stop all syslog accounting */
                        drop_accounting("log");
                        /* or stop missed calls and cdr accounting for s
yslog;
                         * normal accounting will still be enabled */
                        drop_accounting("log", "missed|cdr");
                        /* or stop all types of accounting  */
                        drop_accounting();
                }
                ...

1.8.3.  acc_log_request(comment)

   acc_request reports on a request, for example, it can be used
   to report on missed calls to off-line users who are replied 404
   - Not Found. To avoid multiple reports on UDP request
   retransmission, you would need to embed the action in stateful
   processing.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * comment (string) - Comment describing how the request
       completed - this string has to contain a reply code
       followed by a reply reason phrase (ex: "480 Nobody Home").
       Variables are accepted in this string.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.23. acc_log_request usage
...
acc_log_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.8.4.  acc_db_request(comment, table)

   Like acc_log_request, acc_db_request reports on a request. The
   report is sent to database at “db_url”, in the table referred
   to in the second action parameter.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * comment (string) - Comment describing how the request
       completed - this string has to contain a reply code
       followed by a reply reason phrase (ex: "480 Nobody Home").
       Variables are accepted in this string.
     * table (string) - Database table to be used.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.24. acc_db_request usage
...
acc_db_request("Some comment", "Some table");
acc_db_request("$T_reply_code $(<reply>rr)", "acc");
...

1.8.5.  acc_aaa_request(comment)

   Like acc_log_request, acc_aaa_request reports on a request. It
   reports to aaa server as configured in “aaa_url”.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * comment (string) - Comment describing how the request
       completed - this string has to contain a reply code
       followed by a reply reason phrase (ex: "404 Nobody home").
       Variables are accepted in this string.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.25. acc_aaa_request usage
...
acc_aaa_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.8.6.  acc_evi_request(comment)

   Like acc_log_request, acc_evi_request reports on a request. The
   report is packed as an event sent through the OpenSIPS Event
   Interface as E_ACC_EVENT if the reply code is a positive one
   (lower than 300), or E_ACC_MISSED_EVENT for negative or no
   codes. More information on this in Exported Events.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * comment (string) - Comment describing how the request
       completed - this string has to contain a reply code
       followed by a reply reason phrase (ex: "404 Nobody home")

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.26. acc_evi_request usage
...
acc_evi_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.8.7.  acc_new_leg()

   Creates a new leg and increments $acc_current_leg only if
   multi-leg accounting is used. All values of the new leg will be
   initialized to null.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.27. acc_new_leg usage
...
        acc_new_leg();
...

1.8.8.  acc_load_ctx_from_dlg()

   The function loads and exposes the accounting context of the
   currently in-use dialog. By dialog context, it means, from
   script level, you will read/write the accounting variables from
   the other dialog. The current accounting context is stashed
   until an unload operation is done.

   Note that this functions makes sense only when used together
   with the load_dialog_ctx() function from the dialog module.
   After loading the context of another dialog, by using the
   acc_load_ctx_from_dlg() function, you can also access the
   accounting context of the loaded dialog.

   NOTE: you cannot perform a new load until doing an unload - no
   nested loadings are allowed.

   This function can be used from any type of route.

   Example 1.28. acc_load_ctx_from_dlg usage
...
if ( load_dialog_ctx("$var(callid)") ) {
        # we now have the dialog context of the new dialog
        acc_load_ctx_from_dlg();
        # we have now also the accouting context of that dialog
        xlog("The accounting caller of call '$var(callid)' "
                "is '$acc_extra(caller)'\n");
        acc_unload_ctx_from_dlg();
        unload_dialog_ctx();
}

...

1.8.9.  acc_unload_ctx_from_dlg()

   The function off-loads a previosuly loaded accounting context,
   exposing whatever accounting context was present before doing
   the load.

   NOTE: you MUST perform from script an explicit unload for each
   load you did!

   This function can be used from any type of route.

   For usage example, see the acc_load_ctx_from_dlg().

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

   What happened with old report_ack parameter

   The parameter is considered obsolete. It was removed as acc
   module is doing SIP transaction based accouting and according
   to SIP RFC, end2end ACKs are a different transaction (still
   part of the same dialog). ACKs can be individually accouted as
   any other sequential (in-dialog) request.
   $

   2.2.

   What happened with old log_fmt parameter

   The parameter became obsolete with the restructure of the data
   logged by ACC module (refer to the Overview chapter). For
   similar behaviour you can use the extra accouting (see the
   corresponding chapter).

   2.3.

   What happened with old multi_leg_enabled parameter

   The parameter became obsolete by the addition of the new
   multi_leg_info parameter. The multi-leg accouting is
   automatically enabled when multi_leg_info is defined.

   2.4.

   What happened with old src_leg_avp_id and dst_leg_avp_id
   parameters

   The parameter was replaced by the more generic new parameter
   multi_leg_info. This allows logging (per-leg) of more
   information than just dst and src.
