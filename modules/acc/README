Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   ACC module is used to account transactions information to
   different backends like syslog, SQL, AAA and DIAMETER (beta
   version).

   To account a transaction and to choose which set of backends to
   be used, the script writer just has to set some flags (see the
   module parameters section for flag definitions Section 1.6,
   “Exported Parameters”). If the accounting flag for a specific
   backend is set, the acc module will then report on completed
   transaction. A typical usage of the module takes no
   acc-specific script command -- the functionality binds
   invisibly through transaction processing. Script writers just
   need to mark the transaction for accounting with proper
   setflag. Even so, the module allows the script writter to force
   accounting in special cases via some script functions.

   The accounting module will log by default a fixed set of
   attributes for the transaction - if you customize your
   accounting by adding more information to be logged, please see
   the next chapter about extra accounting - Section 1.2, “Extra
   accounting”.

   The fixed minimal accounting information is:
     * Request Method name
     * From header TAG parameter
     * To header TAG parameter
     * Call-Id
     * 3-digit Status code from final reply
     * Reason phrase from final reply
     * Time stamp when transaction was completed

   If a value is not present in request, the empty string is
   accounted instead.

   Note that:
     * A single INVITE may produce multiple accounting reports --
       that's due to SIP forking feature.
     * All flags related to accounting need to be set in request
       processing route - only the "missed-call" flag may be
       toggled from other types of routes.
     * OpenSIPS now supports session/dialog accounting. It can
       automatically correlate INVITEs with BYEs for generating
       proper CDRs, for example for purpose of billing.
     * If a UA fails in middle of conversation, a proxy will never
       find out about it. In general, a better practice is to
       account from an end-device (such as PSTN gateway), which
       best knows about call status (including media status and
       PSTN status in case of the gateway).

   The SQL, Event Interface and AAA backend support are compiled
   in the module. For DIAMETER you need to enable it by
   recompiling the module with properly set defines: uncomment
   DIAM_ACC line in modules/acc/Makefile. The AAA client needs to
   be configured properly.

   NOTE: diameter support was developed for DISC (DIameter Server
   Client project at http://developer.berlios.de/projects/disc/).
   This project seems to be no longer maintained and DIAMETER
   specifications were updated in the meantime. Thus, the DIAMETER
   part in the module is obsolete and needs rework to be usable
   with opendiameter or other DIAMETER servers.

1.1.1. General Example

loadmodule "modules/acc/acc.so"
modparam("acc", "log_level", 1)
modparam("acc", "log_flag", "LOG_FLAG")

if (uri=~"sip:+40") /* calls to Romania */ {
    if (!proxy_authorize("sip_domain.net" /* realm */,
    "subscriber" /* table name */))  {
        proxy_challenge("sip_domain.net" /* realm */, "0" /* no qop */ )
;
        exit;
    }

    if (is_method("INVITE") && !db_check_from()) {
        log("from!=digest\n");
        sl_send_reply("403","Forbidden");
    }

    setflag(LOG_FLAG); /* set for accounting (the same value as in log_f
lag!)
    t_relay();  /* enter stateful mode now */
};

1.2. Extra accounting

1.2.1. Overview

   Along the static default information, ACC modules allows
   dynamical selection of extra information to be logged. This
   allows you to log any pseudo-variable (AVPs, parts of the
   request, parts of the reply, etc).

1.2.2. Definitions and syntax

   Selection of extra information is done via xxx_extra parameters
   by specifying the names of additional information you want to
   log. This information is defined via pseudo-variables and may
   include headers, AVPs values or other message or system values.
   The syntax of the parameter is:
     * xxx_extra = extra_definition (';'extra_definition)*
     * extra_definition = log_name '=' pseudo_variable ['/reply']

   Each PV (pseudo variable) may be evaluated in the context of
   the request message (to access info from it) or in the context
   of the reply message (final reply for the request).

   Using “/reply” marker, the PV will be evaluated in the context
   of the reply; by default (without the marker), the evaluation
   is done in the contect of the request. This will allow you to
   automatically account information (message or network related)
   from both request and reply in the same time.

   The full list of supported pseudo-variables in OpenSIPS is
   availabe at:
   http://www.opensips.org/pmwiki.php?n=Resources.DocsCoreVar

   Via log_name you define how/where the data will be logged. Its
   meaning depends of the accounting support which is used:
     * LOG accounting - log_name will be just printed along with
       the data in log_name=data format;
     * DB accounting - log_name will be the name of the DB column
       where the data will be stored.IMPORTANT: add in db acc
       table the columns corresponding to each extra data;
     * AAA accounting - log_name will be the AVP name used for
       packing the data into AAA message. The log_name will be
       translated to AVP number via the dictionary. IMPORTANT: add
       in AAA dictionary the log_name attribute.
     * DIAMETER accounting - log_name will be the AVP code used
       for packing the data into DIAMETER message. The AVP code is
       given directly as integer, since DIAMETER has no dictionary
       support yet. IMPORTANT: log_name must be a number.
     * Events accounting - log_name will be the name of the
       parameter in the event raised.

1.2.3. How it works

   Some pseudo variables may return more than one value (like
   headers or AVPs). In this case, the returned values are
   embedded in a single string in a comma-separated format.

1.3. Multi Call-Legs accounting

1.3.1. Overview

   A SIP call can have multiple legs due forwarding actions. For
   example user A calls user B which forwards the call to user C.
   There is only one SIP call but with 2 legs ( A to B and B to
   C). Accounting the legs of a call is required for proper
   billing of the calls (if C is a PSTN number and the call is
   billed, user B must pay for the call - as last party modifing
   the call destination-, and not A - as initiator of the call.
   Call forwarding on server is only one example which shows the
   necessity of the having an accounting engine with multiple legs
   support.

1.3.2. Configuration

   First how it works: The idea is to have a set of AVPs and for
   each call leg to store a set of values in the AVPs. The meaning
   of the AVP content is stricly decided by the script writer - it
   can be the origin and source of the leg, its status or any
   other related information. If you have a set of 4 AVPS (AVP1,
   AVP2, AVP3, AVP4), then for the "A call B and B forwards to C"
   example, you need to set a different set of values for the AVPs
   for each leg ([A,B] and [B,C]) . The script writer must take
   care and properly insert all these AVP from the script (in
   proper order and with the correct type).

   When the accounting information for the call will be
   written/sent, all the call-leg pairs will be added (based on
   the found AVP sets).

   By default, the multiple call-leg support is disabled - it can
   be enabled just by setting the per-leg set of AVPs via the
   multi_leg_info and/or multi_leg_bye_info module parameters.
   Note that the last one only makes sense only for CDRs that are
   generated automatically by OpenSIPS.

   Important: when both multi-leg accounting is done (for INVITE
   and BYE), you have to make sure that the AVPs are populated
   with the same number of legs, otherwise the multi-leg
   accounting will have an unexpected behavior (values may no
   longer match the leg number).

1.3.3. Logged data

   For each call, all the values of the AVP set (which defines a
   call-leg) will be logged. How the information will be actually
   logged, depends of the data backend:
     * syslog -- all leg-sets will be added to one record string
       as AVP1=xxx, AVP2=xxxx ,... sets.
     * database -- each pair will be separately logged (due DB
       data structure constraints); several records will be
       written, the difference between them being only the fields
       corresponding to the call-leg info.

Note
       You will need to add in your DB (all acc related tables)
       the colums for call-leg info (a column for each AVP of the
       set).
     * AAA -- all sets will be added to the same AAA accounting
       message as AAA AVPs - for each call-leg a set of AAA AVPs
       will be added (corresponding to the per-leg AVP set)

Note
       You will need to add in your dictionary the AAA AVPs used
       in call-leg AVP set definition.
     * Diameter same as for AAA.
     * events -- each pair will appear as a different
       parameter-value pair in the event. Similar to the database
       behavior, multiple events will be raised, and the only
       difference between them is the leg information.

1.4. CDRs accounting

1.4.1. Overview

   ACC module can now also maintain session/dialog accounting.
   This allows you to log useful information like call duration,
   call start time and setup time.

1.4.2. Configuration

   In order to have CDRs accounting, first you need to specify the
   cdr_flag parameter. In the script, you must set the
   corresponding flag for the calls that you want to log. The flag
   is only meant to be set on the initial INVITE of the dialog.

1.4.3. How it works

   This type of accounting is based on the dialog module. When an
   initial INVITE is received, if the cdr_flag is set, then the
   dialog creation time is saved. Once the call is answered and
   the ACK is received, other information like extra values or leg
   values are saved. When the corresponding BYE is received, the
   call duration is computed and all information is stored to the
   desired backend.

1.5. Dependencies

1.5.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other words
   the listed modules must be loaded before this module):
     * tm -- Transaction Manager
     * a database module -- If SQL support is used.
     * rr -- Record Route, if “detect_direction” module parameter
       is enabled.
     * an aaa module
     * dialog -- Dialog, if “cdr_flag” is set.

1.5.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none.

1.6. Exported Parameters

1.6.1. early_media (integer)

   Should be early media (any provisional reply with body)
   accounted too ?

   Default value is 0 (no).

   Example 1.1. early_media example
modparam("acc", "early_media", 1)

1.6.2. failed_transaction_flag (string/integer)

   Per transaction flag which says if the transaction should be
   accounted also in case of failure (status>=300).

   WARNING: Setting INT flags is deprecated! Use quoted strings
   instead!

   Default value is not-set (no flag).

   Example 1.2. failed_transaction_flag example
modparam("acc", "failed_transaction_flag", "FAIL_TRANS_FLAG")

1.6.3. report_cancels (integer)

   By default, CANCEL reporting is disabled -- most accounting
   applications wants to see INVITE's cancellation status. Turn on
   if you explicitly want to account CANCEL transactions.

   Default value is 0 (no).

   Example 1.3. report_cancels example
modparam("acc", "report_cancels", 1)

1.6.4. detect_direction (integer)

   Controls the direction detection for sequential requests. If
   enabled (non zero value), for sequential requests with upstream
   direction (from callee to caller), the FROM and TO will be
   swapped (the direction will be preserved as in the original
   request).

   It affects all values related to TO and FROM headers (body,
   URI, username, domain, TAG).

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.4. detect_direction example
modparam("acc", "detect_direction", 1)

1.6.5. multi_leg_info (string)

   Defines the AVP set to be used in per-call-leg accounting. See
   Section 1.3, “Multi Call-Legs accounting” for a detailed
   description of the Multi Call-Legs accounting.

   If empty, the multi-leg accounting support will be disabled.

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.5. multi_leg_info example
# for syslog-based accounting, use any text you want to be printed
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "text1=$avp(src);text2=$avp(dst)")
# for mysql-based accounting, use the names of the columns
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "leg_src=$avp(src);leg_dst=$avp(dst)")
# for AAA-based accounting, use the names of the AAA AVPs
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "AAA_LEG_SRC=$avp(src);AAA_LEG_DST=$avp(dst)")
# for DIAMETER-based accounting, use the DIAMETER AVP ID (as integer)
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "2345=$avp(src);2346=$avp(dst)")

1.6.6. multi_leg_bye_info (string)

   Defines the AVP set to be used in per-call-leg accounting. See
   Section 1.3, “Multi Call-Legs accounting” for a detailed
   description of the Multi Call-Legs accounting. This parameter
   evaluates the AVPs set for BYE requests. It makes sense only
   when the CDRs are automatically generated, using the dialog
   support.

   If empty, the multi-leg support for BYE requests is disabled.

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.6. multi_leg_bye_info example
# for syslog-based accounting, use any text you want to be printed
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_bye_info",
    "text1=$avp(src);text2=$avp(dst)")
# for mysql-based accounting, use the names of the columns
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_bye_info",
    "leg_src=$avp(src);leg_dst=$avp(dst)")
# for AAA-based accounting, use the names of the AAA AVPs
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_bye_info",
    "AAA_LEG_SRC=$avp(src);AAA_LEG_SRC=$avp(dst)")

1.6.7. log_flag (string/integer)

   Request flag which needs to be set to account a transaction via
   syslog.

   WARNING: Setting INT flags is deprecated! Use quoted strings
   instead!

   Default value is not-set (no flag).

   Example 1.7. log_flag example
modparam("acc", "log_flag", "LOG_FLAG")

1.6.8. log_missed_flag (string/integer)

   Request flag which needs to be set to account missed calls via
   syslog.

   WARNING: Setting INT flags is deprecated! Use quoted strings

modparam("acc", "log_missed_flag", "LOG_MISSED_FLAG")

1.6.9. log_level (integer)

   Log level at which accounting messages are issued to syslog.

   Default value is L_NOTICE.

   Example 1.9. log_level example
modparam("acc", "log_level", 2)   # Set log_level to 2

1.6.10. log_facility (string)

   Log facility to which accounting messages are issued to syslog.
   This allows to easily seperate the accounting specific logging
   from the other log messages.

   Default value is LOG_DAEMON.

   Example 1.10. log_facility example
modparam("acc", "log_facility", "LOG_DAEMON")

1.6.11. log_extra (string)

1.6.12. log_extra_bye (string)

   Extra values to be logged to logfile. Note that this parameter
   makes sense only when the cdr_flag is used.

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.12. log_extra_bye example
modparam("acc", "log_extra_bye",
        "uaA=$hdr(User-Agent);uaB=$hdr(Server)/reply;uuid=$avp(123)")

1.6.13. aaa_url (string)

   This is the url representing the AAA protocol used and the
   location of the configuration file of this protocol.

   If the parameter is set to empty string, the AAA accounting
   support will be disabled.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.13. Set aaa_url parameter
...
modparam("acc", "aaa_url", "radius:/etc/radiusclient-ng/radiusclient.con

     * comment - Comment describing how the request completed -
       this string has to contain a reply code followed by a reply
       reason phrase (ex: "404 Nobody home"). Variables are
       accepted in this string.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.44. acc_log_request usage
...
acc_log_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.7.2.  acc_db_request(comment, table)

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

       What happened with old report_ack parameter

       The parameter is considered obsolete. It was removed as acc
       module is doing SIP transaction based accouting and according
       to SIP RFC, end2end ACKs are a different transaction (still
       part of the same dialog). ACKs can be individually accouted as
       any other sequential (in-dialog) request.
       $

   2.2.

       What happened with old log_fmt parameter

       The parameter became obsolete with the restructure of the data
       logged by ACC module (refer to the Overview chapter). For
       similar behaviour you can use the extra accouting (see the
       corresponding chapter).

   2.3.

       What happened with old multi_leg_enabled parameter

       The parameter became obsolete by the addition of the new
       multi_leg_info parameter. The multi-leg accouting is
       automatically enabled when multi_leg_info is defined.

   2.4.

       What happened with old src_leg_avp_id and dst_leg_avp_id
       parameters

       The parameter was replaced by the more generic new parameter
       multi_leg_info. This allows logging (per-leg) of more
       information than just dst and src.
