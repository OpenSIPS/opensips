Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   ACC module is used to account transactions information to
   different backends like syslog, SQL, AAA and DIAMETER (beta
   version).

   To account a transaction and to choose which set of backends to
   be used, the script writer just has to use mark the transaction
   for accouting by using the Section 1.7.1, “ do_accounting(type,
   flags, table) ” script function. Note that the function is not
   actually doing the accounting at that very process, it is just
   setting a marker - the actual accouting will be done later when
   the transaction or dialog will be completed.

   Even so, the module allows the script writter to force
   accounting on the spot in special cases via some other script
   functions.

   The accounting module will log by default a fixed set of
   attributes for the transaction - if you customize your
   accounting by adding more information to be logged, please see
   the next chapter about extra accounting - Section 1.2, “Extra
   accounting”.

   The fixed minimal accounting information is:
     * Request Method name
     * From header TAG parameter
     * To header TAG parameter
     * Call-Id
     * 3-digit Status code from final reply
     * Reason phrase from final reply
     * Time stamp when transaction was completed

   If a value is not present in request, the empty string is
   accounted instead.

   Note that:
     * A single INVITE may produce multiple accounting reports --
       that's due to SIP forking feature.
     * Since version 2.2 all flags used for accounting have been
       replaced by the do_accounting function. No need to worry
       anymore of whether you have set the flags or not, or be
       confused by various flag names, now you only have to call
       the function and it will do all the work for you.
     * OpenSIPS now supports session/dialog accounting. It can
       automatically correlate INVITEs with BYEs for generating
       proper CDRs, for example for purpose of billing.
     * If a UA fails in middle of conversation, a proxy will never
       find out about it. In general, a better practice is to
       account from an end-device (such as PSTN gateway), which
       best knows about call status (including media status and
       PSTN status in case of the gateway).

   The SQL, Event Interface and AAA backend support are compiled
   in the module.

   A very comprehensive description of how the accounting module
   works in terms accounting scope, accounting events and
   accounting backends can be found in this online Advanced
   Accounting Tutorial.

1.1.1. General Example

loadmodule "modules/acc/acc.so"

if (uri=~"sip:+40") /* calls to Romania */ {
    if (!proxy_authorize("sip_domain.net" /* realm */,
    "subscriber" /* table name */))  {
        proxy_challenge("sip_domain.net" /* realm */, "0" /* no qop */ )
;
        exit;
    }

    if (is_method("INVITE") && !db_check_from()) {
        xlog("FROM URI != digest username\n");
        sl_send_reply("403","Forbidden");
    }

    do_accounting("log"); /* set for accounting via syslog */
    t_relay(); /* enter stateful mode now */
};

1.2. Extra accounting

1.2.1. Overview

   Along the static default information, ACC modules allows
   dynamical selection of extra information to be logged. This
   allows you to log any pseudo-variable (AVPs, parts of the
   request, parts of the reply, etc).

1.2.2. Definitions and syntax

   Selection of extra information is done via xxx_extra parameters
   by specifying the names of additional information you want to
   log. This information is defined via pseudo-variables and may
   include headers, AVPs values or other message or system values.
   The syntax of the parameter is:
     * xxx_extra = extra_definition (';'extra_definition)*
     * extra_definition = log_name '=' pseudo_variable ['/reply']

   Each PV (pseudo variable) may be evaluated in the context of
   the request message (to access info from it) or in the context
   of the reply message (final reply for the request).

   Using “/reply” marker, the PV will be evaluated in the context
   of the reply; by default (without the marker), the evaluation
   is done in the contect of the request. This will allow you to
   automatically account information (message or network related)
   from both request and reply in the same time.

   The full list of supported pseudo-variables in OpenSIPS is
   availabe at:
   http://www.opensips.org/pmwiki.php?n=Resources.DocsCoreVar

   Via log_name you define how/where the data will be logged. Its
   meaning depends of the accounting support which is used:
     * LOG accounting - log_name will be just printed along with
       the data in log_name=data format;
     * DB accounting - log_name will be the name of the DB column
       where the data will be stored.IMPORTANT: add in db acc
       table the columns corresponding to each extra data;
     * AAA accounting - log_name will be the AVP name used for
       packing the data into AAA message. The log_name will be
       translated to AVP number via the dictionary. IMPORTANT: add
       in AAA dictionary the log_name attribute.
     * DIAMETER accounting - log_name will be the AVP code used
       for packing the data into DIAMETER message. The AVP code is
       given directly as integer, since DIAMETER has no dictionary
       support yet. IMPORTANT: log_name must be a number.
     * Events accounting - log_name will be the name of the
       parameter in the event raised.

1.2.3. How it works

   Some pseudo variables may return more than one value (like
   headers or AVPs). In this case, the returned values are
   embedded in a single string in a comma-separated format.

1.2.4. Radius accounting dependencies

   If radius accounting is used, except from a radius client
   library which is mandatory, dictionary.rfc2866 must be included
   for the module to work properly.

1.3. Multi Call-Legs accounting

1.3.1. Overview

   A SIP call can have multiple legs due forwarding actions. For
   example user A calls user B which forwards the call to user C.
   There is only one SIP call but with 2 legs ( A to B and B to
   C). Accounting the legs of a call is required for proper
   billing of the calls (if C is a PSTN number and the call is
   billed, user B must pay for the call - as last party modifing
   the call destination-, and not A - as initiator of the call.
   Call forwarding on server is only one example which shows the
   necessity of the having an accounting engine with multiple legs
   support.

1.3.2. Configuration

   First how it works: The idea is to have a set of AVPs and for
   each call leg to store a set of values in the AVPs. The meaning
   of the AVP content is stricly decided by the script writer - it
   can be the origin and source of the leg, its status or any
   other related information. If you have a set of 4 AVPS (AVP1,
   AVP2, AVP3, AVP4), then for the "A call B and B forwards to C"
   example, you need to set a different set of values for the AVPs
   for each leg ([A,B] and [B,C]) . The script writer must take
   care and properly insert all these AVP from the script (in
   proper order and with the correct type).

   When the accounting information for the call will be
   written/sent, all the call-leg pairs will be added (based on
   the found AVP sets).

   By default, the multiple call-leg support is disabled - it can
   be enabled just by setting the per-leg set of AVPs via the
   multi_leg_info and/or multi_leg_bye_info module parameters.
   Note that the last one only makes sense only for CDRs that are
   generated automatically by OpenSIPS.

   Important: when both multi-leg accounting is done (for INVITE
   and BYE), you have to make sure that the AVPs are populated
   with the same number of legs, otherwise the multi-leg
   accounting will have an unexpected behavior (values may no
   longer match the leg number).

1.3.3. Logged data

   For each call, all the values of the AVP set (which defines a
   call-leg) will be logged. How the information will be actually
   logged, depends of the data backend:
     * syslog -- all leg-sets will be added to one record string
       as AVP1=xxx, AVP2=xxxx ,... sets.
     * database -- each pair will be separately logged (due DB
       data structure constraints); several records will be
       written, the difference between them being only the fields
       corresponding to the call-leg info.

Note
       You will need to add in your DB (all acc related tables)
       the colums for call-leg info (a column for each AVP of the
       set).
     * AAA -- all sets will be added to the same AAA accounting
       message as AAA AVPs - for each call-leg a set of AAA AVPs
       will be added (corresponding to the per-leg AVP set)

Note
       You will need to add in your dictionary the AAA AVPs used
       in call-leg AVP set definition.
     * Diameter same as for AAA.
     * events -- each pair will appear as a different
       parameter-value pair in the event. Similar to the database
       behavior, multiple events will be raised, and the only
       difference between them is the leg information.

   Important!!! In order to use RADIUS, one must include the AVPs
   which are located in
   $(opensips_install_dir)/etc/dictionary.opensips, both in
   opensips radius config script dictionary and radius server
   dictionary. Most important are the last three AVPs (IDs : 227,
   228, 229) which you won't find in any SIP dictionary (at least
   at this moment) because they are only used in openSips.

1.4. CDRs accounting

1.4.1. Overview

   ACC module can now also maintain session/dialog accounting.
   This allows you to log useful information like call duration,
   call start time and setup time.

1.4.2. Configuration

   In order to have CDRs accounting, first you need to set the cdr
   flag when calling Section 1.7.1, “ do_accounting(type, flags,
   table) ” script function for the initial INVITE of the dialog.

1.4.3. How it works

   This type of accounting is based on the dialog module. When an
   initial INVITE is received, if the cdr flag is set, then the
   dialog creation time is saved. Once the call is answered and
   the ACK is received, other information like extra values or leg
   values are saved. When the corresponding BYE is received, the
   call duration is computed and all information is stored to the
   desired backend.

1.5. Dependencies

1.5.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other words
   the listed modules must be loaded before this module):
     * tm -- Transaction Manager
     * a database module -- If SQL support is used.
     * rr -- Record Route, if “detect_direction” module parameter
       is enabled.
     * an aaa module
     * dialog -- Dialog, if “cdr” option is used

1.5.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none.

1.6. Exported Parameters

1.6.1. early_media (integer)

   Should be early media (any provisional reply with body)
   accounted too ?

   Default value is 0 (no).

   Example 1.1. early_media example
modparam("acc", "early_media", 1)

1.6.2. report_cancels (integer)

   By default, CANCEL reporting is disabled -- most accounting
   applications wants to see INVITE's cancellation status. Turn on
   if you explicitly want to account CANCEL transactions.

   Default value is 0 (no).

   Example 1.2. report_cancels example
modparam("acc", "report_cancels", 1)

1.6.3. detect_direction (integer)

   Controls the direction detection for sequential requests. If
   enabled (non zero value), for sequential requests with upstream
   direction (from callee to caller), the FROM and TO will be
   swapped (the direction will be preserved as in the original
   request).

   It affects all values related to TO and FROM headers (body,
   URI, username, domain, TAG).

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.3. detect_direction example
modparam("acc", "detect_direction", 1)

1.6.4. multi_leg_info (string)

   Defines the AVP set to be used in per-call-leg accounting. See
   Section 1.3, “Multi Call-Legs accounting” for a detailed
   description of the Multi Call-Legs accounting.

   If empty, the multi-leg accounting support will be disabled.

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.4. multi_leg_info example
# for syslog-based accounting, use any text you want to be printed
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "text1=$avp(src);text2=$avp(dst)")
# for mysql-based accounting, use the names of the columns
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "leg_src=$avp(src);leg_dst=$avp(dst)")
# for AAA-based accounting, use the names of the AAA AVPs
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "AAA_LEG_SRC=$avp(src);AAA_LEG_DST=$avp(dst)")
# for DIAMETER-based accounting, use the DIAMETER AVP ID (as integer)
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_info",
    "2345=$avp(src);2346=$avp(dst)")

1.6.5. multi_leg_bye_info (string)

   Defines the AVP set to be used in per-call-leg accounting. See
   Section 1.3, “Multi Call-Legs accounting” for a detailed
   description of the Multi Call-Legs accounting. This parameter
   evaluates the AVPs set for BYE requests. It makes sense only
   when the CDRs are automatically generated, using the dialog
   support. Note: since the CDR is generated when the BYE message
   matches the dialog, these variables need to be populated before
   calling loose_route() or match_dialog().

   If empty, the multi-leg support for BYE requests is disabled.

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.5. multi_leg_bye_info example
# for syslog-based accounting, use any text you want to be printed
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_bye_info",
    "text1=$avp(src);text2=$avp(dst)")
# for mysql-based accounting, use the names of the columns
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_bye_info",
    "leg_src=$avp(src);leg_dst=$avp(dst)")
# for AAA-based accounting, use the names of the AAA AVPs
modparam("acc", "multi_leg_bye_info",
    "AAA_LEG_SRC=$avp(src);AAA_LEG_SRC=$avp(dst)")

1.6.6. log_level (integer)

   Log level at which accounting messages are issued to syslog.

   Default value is L_NOTICE.

   Example 1.6. log_level example
modparam("acc", "log_level", 2)   # Set log_level to 2

1.6.7. log_facility (string)

   Log facility to which accounting messages are issued to syslog.
   This allows to easily seperate the accounting specific logging
   from the other log messages.

   Default value is LOG_DAEMON.

   Example 1.7. log_facility example
modparam("acc", "log_facility", "LOG_DAEMON")

1.6.8. log_extra (string)

   Extra values to be logged.

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.8. log_extra example
modparam("acc", "log_extra",
        "uaA=$hdr(User-Agent);uaB=$hdr(Server)/reply;uuid=$avp(123)")

1.6.9. log_extra_bye (string)

   Extra values to be logged to logfile. Note that this parameter
   makes sense only when the cdr option is used with
   do_accounting(). Note: since the CDR is generated when the BYE
   message matches the dialog, these variables need to be
   populated before calling loose_route() or match_dialog().

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.9. log_extra_bye example
modparam("acc", "log_extra_bye",
        "uaA=$hdr(User-Agent);uaB=$hdr(Server)/reply;uuid=$avp(123)")

1.6.10. aaa_url (string)

   This is the url representing the AAA protocol used and the
   location of the configuration file of this protocol.

   If the parameter is set to empty string, the AAA accounting
   support will be disabled.

   Default value is “NULL”.

   Example 1.10. Set aaa_url parameter
...
modparam("acc", "aaa_url", "radius:/etc/radiusclient-ng/radiusclient.con
f")
...

1.6.11. service_type (integer)

   AAA service type used for accounting.

   Default value is not-set.

   Example 1.11. service_type example
# Default value of service type for SIP is 15
modparam("acc", "service_type", 15)

1.6.12. aaa_extra (string)

   Extra values to be logged via AAA - AAA specific.

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.12. aaa_extra example
modparam("acc", "aaa_extra",
        "via=$hdr(Via[*]); email=$avp(email); Bcontact=$ct / reply")

1.6.13. aaa_extra_bye (string)

   Extra values to be logged via AAA when a BYE message is
   received - AAA specific. Note that this parameter makes sense
   only when the cdr option is used with do_accounting. Note:
   since the CDR is generated when the BYE message matches the
   dialog, these variables need to be populated before calling
   loose_route() or match_dialog().

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.13. aaa_extra_bye example
modparam("acc", "aaa_extra_bye",
        "via=$hdr(Via[*]); email=$avp(email); Bcontact=$ct / reply")

1.6.14. db_table_acc (string)

   Table name of accounting successfull calls -- database
   specific.

   Default value is “acc”

   Example 1.14. db_table_acc example
modparam("acc", "db_table_acc", "myacc_table")

1.6.15. db_table_missed_calls (string)

   Table name for accounting missed calls -- database specific.

   Default value is “missed_calls”

   Example 1.15. db_table_missed_calls example
modparam("acc", "db_table_missed_calls", "myMC_table")

1.6.16. db_url (string)

   SQL address -- database specific. If is set to NULL or empty
   string, the SQL support is disabled.

   Default value is “NULL” (SQL disabled).

1.6.30. evi_extra_bye (string)

   Extra values to be attached as event's parameters for BYE
   messages. Note that this parameter makes sense only when the
   cdr option is used with do_accounting. Note: since the CDR is
   generated when the BYE message matches the dialog, these
   variables need to be populated before calling loose_route() or
   match_dialog().

   Default value is NULL.

   Example 1.30. evi_extra_bye example
modparam("acc", "evi_extra_bye",

1.7. Exported Functions

1.7.1.  do_accounting(type, flags, table)

   do_accounting() replace all the *_flag and, *_missed_flag,
   cdr_flag, failed transaction_flag and the db_table_avp modpara.
   Just call do_accounting(), select where you want to do
   accounting and how and the function will do all the job for
   you.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * type - the type of accounting you want to do. All the types
       have to be separated by '|'. The following parameters can
       be used:
          + log - syslog accounting;
          + db - database accounting;
          + aaa - aaa specific accounting;
          + evi - Event Interface accounting;
          + diam - Diameter accounting;
     * flags - flags for the accouting type you have selected. All
       the types have to be separated by '|'. The following
       parameters can be used:
          + cdr - also set CDR details when doing accounting;
            DIALOG MODULE HAS TO BE LOADED;
          + missed - log missed calls;
          + failed - flag which says if the transaction should be
            accounted also in case of failure (status>=300);
     * table - table where to do the accounting; it replaces old
       table_avp parameter;

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.32. do_accounting usage
                ...
                if (!has_totag()) {
                        if (is_method("INVITE")) {
                        /* enable cdr and missed calls accounting in the
 database
                         * and to syslog; db accounting shall be done in
 "my_acc" table */
                                do_accounting("db|log", "cdr|missed", "m
y_acc");
                        }
                }
                ...
                if (is_method("BYE")) {
                        /* do normal accounting via aaa */
                        do_accounting("aaa");
                }
                ...

1.7.2.  drop_accounting([type], [flags])

   drop_accounting() resets flags and types of accounting set with
   do_accounting(). If called with no arguments all accounting
   will be stopped. If called with only one argument all
   accounting for that type will be stopped. If called with two
   arguments normal accounting will still be enabled.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * type - the type of accounting you want to stop. All the
       types have to be separated by '|'. The following parameters
       can be used:
          + log - stop syslog accounting;
          + db - stop database accounting;
          + aaa - stop aaa specific accounting;
          + evi - stop Event Interface accounting;
          + diam - stop Diameter accounting;
     * flags - flags to be reset for the accouting type you have
       selected. All the types have to be separated by '|'. The
       following parameters can be used:
          + cdr - stop CDR accounting;
          + missed - stop logging missed calls;
          + failed - stop failed transaction accounting;

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.33. drop_accounting usage
                ...
                acc_log_request("403 Destination not allowed");
                if (!has_totag()) {
                        if (is_method("INVITE")) {
                        /* enable cdr and missed calls accounting in the
 database
                         * and to syslog; db accounting shall be done in
 "my_acc" table */
                                do_accounting("db|log", "cdr|missed", "m
y_acc");
                        }
                }
                ...
                /* later in your script */
                if (...) { /* you don't want accounting anymore */
                        /* stop all syslog accounting */
                        drop_accounting("log");
                        /* or stop missed calls and cdr accounting for s
yslog;
                         * normal accounting will still be enabled */
                        drop_accounting("log","missed|cdr");
                        /* or stop all types of accounting  */
                        drop_accounting();
                }
                ...

1.7.3.  acc_log_request(comment)

   acc_request reports on a request, for example, it can be used
   to report on missed calls to off-line users who are replied 404

   retransmission, you would need to embed the action in stateful
   processing.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * comment - Comment describing how the request completed -
       this string has to contain a reply code followed by a reply
       reason phrase (ex: "404 Nobody home"). Variables are
       accepted in this string.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.34. acc_log_request usage
...
acc_log_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.7.4.  acc_db_request(comment, table)

   Like acc_log_request, acc_db_request reports on a request. The

     * comment - Comment describing how the request completed -
       this string has to contain a reply code followed by a reply
       reason phrase (ex: "404 Nobody home"). Variables are
       accepted in this string.
     * table - Database table to be used.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.35. acc_db_request usage
...
acc_db_request("Some comment", "Some table");
acc_db_request("$T_reply_code $(<reply>rr)","acc");
...

   reports to aaa server as configured in “aaa_url”.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * comment - Comment describing how the request completed -
       this string has to contain a reply code followed by a reply
       reason phrase (ex: "404 Nobody home"). Variables are
       accepted in this string.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, FAILURE_ROUTE,
   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.36. acc_aaa_request usage
...
acc_aaa_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.7.6.  acc_diam_request(comment)

   BRANCH_ROUTE and LOCAL_ROUTE.

   Example 1.37. acc_diam_request usage
...
acc_diam_request("403 Destination not allowed");
...

1.7.7.  acc_evi_request(comment)

   Like acc_log_request, acc_evi_request reports on a request. The
   report is packed as an event sent through the OpenSIPS Event
   Interface as E_ACC_EVENT if the reply code is a positive one
   (lower than 300), or E_ACC_MISSED_EVENT for negative or no
   codes. More information on this in Section 1.8, “Exported

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

       What happened with old report_ack parameter

       The parameter is considered obsolete. It was removed as acc
       module is doing SIP transaction based accouting and according
       to SIP RFC, end2end ACKs are a different transaction (still
       part of the same dialog). ACKs can be individually accouted as
       any other sequential (in-dialog) request.
       $

   2.2.

       What happened with old log_fmt parameter

       The parameter became obsolete with the restructure of the data
       logged by ACC module (refer to the Overview chapter). For
       similar behaviour you can use the extra accouting (see the
       corresponding chapter).

   2.3.

       What happened with old multi_leg_enabled parameter

       The parameter became obsolete by the addition of the new
       multi_leg_info parameter. The multi-leg accouting is
       automatically enabled when multi_leg_info is defined.

   2.4.

       What happened with old src_leg_avp_id and dst_leg_avp_id
       parameters

       The parameter was replaced by the more generic new parameter
       multi_leg_info. This allows logging (per-leg) of more
       information than just dst and src.

   2.5.
