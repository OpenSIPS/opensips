Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module provides multiple hooks to run Management Interface
   commands directly from OpenSIPS script. It supports running
   both synchronous and asynchronous commands. Depending on the
   nature of the command (asynchronous or not), and on the way the
   mi command is run from script, the returned result is
   different.

1.2. Values Returned

   In case of success, the MI command returns with success. If a
   return variable is provided as parameter, a JSON is also stored
   in the variable provided.

   In case of failure of the MI command, JSON-RPC reply error code
   is stored in the $rc variable, as a negative number. Lower
   values, such as -1,-2,-3 can also be returned to indicate an
   internal error. If a return variable is provided, it is stored
   to the error description.

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * proto_hep module, in case MI tracing is used.

1.3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. pretty_printing (int)

   Indicates whether the JSON responses stored in the return
   variable should be pretty-printed or not.

   Default value is “0 - no pretty-printing”.

   Example 1.1. Set pretty_printing parameter
...
modparam("mi_script", "pretty_printing", 1)
...

1.4.2. trace_destination (string)

   Trace destination as defined in the tracing module. Currently
   the only tracing module is proto_hep. This is where traced mi
   messages will go.

   WARNING: A tracing module must be loaded in order for this
   parameter to work. (for example proto_hep).

   Default value is none(not defined).

   Example 1.2. Set trace_destination parameter
...
modparam("proto_hep", "trace_destination", "[hep_dest]10.0.0.2;transport
=tcp;version=3")

modparam("mi_stream", "trace_destination", "hep_dest")
...

1.4.3. trace_bwlist (string)

   Filter traced mi commands based on a blacklist or a whitelist.
   trace_destination must be defined for this parameter to have
   any purpose. Whitelists can be defined using 'w' or 'W',
   blacklists using 'b' or 'B'. The type is separate by the actual
   blacklist by ':'. The mi commands in the list must be separated
   by ','.

   Defining a blacklists means all the commands that are not
   blacklisted will be traced. Defining a whitelist means all the
   commands that are not whitelisted will not be traced. WARNING:
   One can't define both a whitelist and a blacklist. Only one of
   them is allowed. Defining the parameter a second time will just
   overwrite the first one.

   WARNING: A tracing module must be loaded in order for this
   parameter to work. (for example proto_hep).

   Default value is none(not defined).

   Example 1.3. Set trace_destination parameter
...
## blacklist ps and which mi commands
## all the other commands shall be traced
modparam("mi_stream", "trace_bwlist", "b: ps, which")
...
## allow only sip_trace mi command
## all the other commands will not be traced
modparam("mi_stream", "trace_bwlist", "w: sip_trace")
...

1.5. Exported Functions

1.5.1.  mi(command, [ret_var [,params_avp[, vals_avp]]])

   Runs an MI command in synchronous mode, blocking until a
   response is available.

   IMPORTANT: it is highly recommended to prevent using this
   function for tasks that take long time, such as reloads, as the
   function would block until the command ends. Moreover, if the
   running MI command is configured to run in asynchronous mode
   (such as t_uac_dlg the command blocks in a busy waiting manner
   until the response is received.

   This function can be used in any route.

   The function can receive the following parameters:
     * command(string) - the MI command to be run. This can be a
       single token, representing the MI command to run (without
       parameters), or can be followed by several space separated
       parameters (no escaping is handled). Each space separated
       parameter will be passed to the MI command as an indexed
       parameter.
       NOTE: named parameters can not be specified using this
       parameter, and you will have to use the params_avp and/or
       the vals_avp parameters to specify named commands, in which
       case this parameter will only consist of the MI command.
     * ret_var(var, optional) - a variable used to store the
       return of the MI command execution. In case of success, a
       JSON is stored, otherwise an erorr message.
     * params_avp(avp, optional) - an AVP consisting of all the
       parameters names that will be sent to the MI command. If
       this parameter is used without the vals_avp, all the values
       inside the AVP will be passed to the MI command as indexed
       parameters, otherwise as named parameters.
       NOTE: if this parameter is used, the parameters specified
       in the command parameter are ignored.
       NOTE: the order the parameters are passed to the command is
       the same as the one you populate the AVPs (thus somehow
       reversed compared to the way AVPs are stored in memory -
       the first AVP added is the first parameter)
     * vals_avp(avp, optional) - an AVP consisting of all the
       parameters values that will be sent to the MI command. This
       parameter only makes sense if the params_avp is set, and
       has to contain the same number of values as there are
       parameters.
       To specify array values, enclose your space-separated array
       elements in the __array() pseudo-function call. For
       example: "__array(HEARTBEAT BACKGROUND_JOB)"

   Example 1.4. mi without params
...
mi("shm_check");
...

   Example 1.5. mi with params in command
...
# this command is similar to the above
mi("cache_remove local password_user1");
...

   Example 1.6. mi with return
...
mi("ds_list", $var(ret));
...

   Example 1.7. mi without return but with indexed params
...
$avp(params) = "local";
$avp(params) = "password_user1";
mi("cache_remove",,$avp(params));

# the following command is similar to the above
mi("cache_remove local password_user1");
...

   Example 1.8. mi with return and named parameters
...
$avp(params) = "callid";
$avp(vals) = "SEARCH_FOR_THIS_CALLID";
$avp(params) = "from_tag";
$avp(vals) = "SEARCH_FOR_THIS_FROM_TAG";
mi("dlg_list", $var(dlg), $avp(params), $avp(vals));
...

   Example 1.9. mi without return, with an array parameter value
...
$avp(params) = "freeswitch_url";
$avp(vals) = "fs://:ClueCon@192.168.20.8:8021";
$avp(params) = "events";
$avp(vals) = "__array(HEARTBEAT BACKGROUND_JOB)";
mi("fs_subscribe", , $avp(params), $avp(vals));
...

1.6. Exported Asyncronous Functions

1.6.1.  mi(command, [ret_var [,params_avp[, vals_avp]]])

   The function works is more or less the same as its synchronous
   corespondent, except that the MI command is run in an
   asynchronous manner - the process does not block to wait for
   the response, but it continues its execution and the MI command
   is run in an asynchronous context.

   NOTE: currently MI commands run asynchronously cannot be traced
   through hep.

   Example 1.10. async mi call usage
...
xlog("reload starting\n");
async(mi("dr_reload"), after_reload);
...

route[after_reload] {
        xlog("reload completed\n");
}
