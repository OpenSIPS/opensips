Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module provides an RFC 7540/9113 HTTP/2 server
   implementation with "h2" ALPN support, based on the nghttp2
   library (https://nghttp2.org/).

   HTTP/2, introduced in 2015, is a binary protocol with added
   transactional layers (SESSION, FRAME), which allow identifying
   and managing multiple, concurrent transfers over the same
   TCP/TLS connection. Thus, the revised protocol primarily aims
   to reduce resource usage for both clients and servers, by
   reducing the amount of TCP and/or TLS handshakes performed when
   loading a given web page.

   The OpenSIPS http2d server includes support for both "h2" (TLS
   secured) and "h2c" (cleartext) HTTP/2 connections. The requests
   arrive at opensips.cfg level using the E_HTTP2_REQUEST event,
   where script writers may process the data and respond
   accordingly.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   None.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The HTTP/2 server is provided by the nghttp2 library, which
   runs on top of the libevent server framework.

   Overall, the following libraries must be installed before
   running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * libnghttp2
     * libevent, libevent_openssl
     * libssl, libcrypto

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. ip (string)

   The listening IPv4 address.

   Default value is "127.0.0.1".

   Example 1.1. Setting the ip parameter

modparam("http2d", "ip", "127.0.0.2")


1.3.2. port (integer)

   The listening port.

   Default value is 443.

   Example 1.2. Setting the port parameter

modparam("http2d", "port", 5000)


1.3.3. tls_cert_path (string)

   File path to the TLS certificate, in PEM format.

   Default value is NULL (not set).

   Example 1.3. Setting the tls_cert_path parameter

modparam("http2d", "tls_cert_path", "/etc/pki/http2/cert.pem")


1.3.4. tls_cert_key (string)

   File path to the TLS private key, in PEM format.

   Default value is NULL (not set).

   Example 1.4. Setting the tls_cert_key parameter

modparam("http2d", "tls_cert_key", "/etc/pki/http2/private/key.pem")


1.3.5. max_headers_size (integer)

   The maximum amount of bytes allowed for all header field names
   and values combined in a single HTTP/2 request processed by the
   server. Once this threshold is reached, extra headers will no
   longer be provided at script level and will be reported as
   errors instead.

   Default value is 8192 bytes.

   Example 1.5. Setting the max_headers_size parameter

modparam("http2d", "max_headers_size", 16384)


1.3.6. response_timeout (integer)

   The maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the library
   will allow the opensips.cfg processing to take for a given
   HTTP/2 request.

   Once this timeout is reached, the module will auto-generate a
   408 (request timeout) reply.

   Default value is 2000 ms.

   Example 1.6. Setting the response_timeout parameter

modparam("http2d", "response_timeout", 5000)


1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  http2_send_response(code, [headers_json], [data])

   Sends a response for the HTTP/2 request being processed. The
   ":status" header field will be automatically included by the
   module as 1st header, so it must not be included in the
   headers_json array.

   Parameters
     * code (integer) - The HTTP/2 reply code
     * headers_json (string, default: NULL) - Optional JSON Array
       containing {"header": "value"} elements, denoting HTTP/2
       headers and their values to be included in the response
       message.
     * data (string, default: NULL) - Optional DATA payload to
       include in the response message.

   Return Codes
     * 1 - Success
     * -1 - Internal Error

   This function can only be used from an EVENT_ROUTE.

   Example 1.7. http2_send_response() usage

event_route [E_HTTP2_REQUEST] {
  xlog(":: Method:  $param(method)\n");
  xlog(":: Path:    $param(path)\n");
  xlog(":: Headers: $param(headers)\n");
  xlog(":: Data:    $param(data)\n");

  $json(hdrs) := $param(headers);
  xlog("content-type: $json(hdrs/content-type)\n");

  $var(rpl_headers) = "[
        { \"content-type\": \"application/json\" },
        { \"server\": \"OpenSIPS 3.5\" },
        { \"x-current-time\": \"1711457142\" },
        { \"x-call-cost\": \"0.355\" }
  ]";

  $var(data) = "{\"status\": \"success\"}";

  if (!http2_send_response(200, $var(rpl_headers), $var(data)))
    xlog("ERROR - failed to send HTTP/2 response\n");
}


1.5. Exported Events

1.5.1.  E_HTTP2_REQUEST

   This event is raised whenever the http2d module is loaded and
   OpenSIPS receives an HTTP/2 request on the configured listening
   interface(s).

   Parameters:
     * method (string) - value of the ":method" HTTP/2 header
     * path (string) - value of the ":path" HTTP/2 header
     * headers (string) - JSON Array with all headers of the
       request, including pseudo-headers
     * data (string, default: NULL) - If the request included a
       payload, this parameter will hold its contents

   Note that this event is currently designed to be mainly
   consumed by an event_route, since that is the only way to gain
   access to the http2_send_response() function in order to build
   custom response messages. On the other hand, if the application
   does not mind the answer being always a 200 with no payload,
   this event can be successfully consumed through any other
   EVI-compatible delivery channel ☺️
