Module depends on: -

This module implement a presence server, i.e. entity that receives
SUBSCRIBE messages and sends NOTIFY when presence status of a user
changes. Currently the presence server can be connected to registar
and jabber module so SIP users can see presence of jabber users.

This module currently cannot work as a B2BUA, i.e. it cannot subsribe
to presence of users using SIP. We are currently working on that feature.
