1.1. Overview

1.1.1.  The idea

   A virtual db will expose the same front db api however, it will
   backed by many real db. This means that a virtual db url
   translates to many real db urls. This virtual layer also
   enables us to use the real dbs in multiple ways such as:
   parallel, failover(hotswap), round-robin. Therefore: each
   virtual db url with associated real dbs and a way to use(mode)
   it's real dbs must be specified.

1.1.2.  Modes

   The implemented modes are:
     * FAILOVER
       Use the first url; if it fails, use the next one, redo
       operation.
     * PARALLEL
       Use all the urls in the virtual db url. Fails if all the
       urls fail.
     * ROUND (round-robin)
       Use the next url each time; if it fails, use the next one,
       redo operation.

   There are conceptual limitations to the above modes with
   respect to the operation. For example in parallel mode it is ok
   to insert into multiple dbs the same value but it is bad to
   query multiple dbs into the same result. This implementation
   threats such operation as it would be in failover mode.

  Conceptual allowed(1) and not allowed(0) operations
                          parallel    round
    dbb->use_table
    dbb->init
    dbb->close

    dbb->query              0           1
    dbb->fetch_result       0           0
    dbb->raw_query          0           1
    dbb->free_result        0           0
    dbb->insert             1           1
    dbb->delete             1           0
    dbb->update             1           0
    dbb->replace            1           0
    dbb->last_inserted_id   0           0
    dbb->insert_update      1           1

   Note 1: The capabilities returned are the minimum common
   denominator of all the dbs in the set. The capabilities are
   reduced even more based on the mode of the set (PARALLEL,
   ROUND).

   Note 2: The capabilities will not be reduced for PARALLEL mode
   but conceptual not allowed operations will be done on a single
   db. Ex: query will only query one db.

1.1.3.  Failures

    When an operation from a process on a real db fails:
        it is marked (global and local CAN flag down)
        its connection closed

    Later a timer process (probe):
    foreach virtual db url
        foreach real db_url
            if global CAN down
                try to connect
            if ok
                global CAN up
                close connection

    Later each process:
        if local CAN down and global CAN up
            if db_max_consec_retrys *
                try to connect
        if ok
            local CAN up


   Note *: there could be inconsistencies between the probe and
   each process so a retry limit is in order. It is reset and
   ignored by an MI command.

1.1.4. The timer process

   The timer process(probe) is a process that tries to reconnect
   to failed dbs from time to time. It is a separate process so
   that when it blocks (for a timeout on the connection) it doesnt
   matter.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * At least one real db module.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1.  db_urls (str)

   Multiple value parameter used for virtual db urls declaration.

   Example 1.1. Set db_urls parameter
...

modparam("group","db_url","virtual://set1")
modparam("presence|presence_xml", "db_url","virtual://set2")

modparam("db_virtual", "db_urls", "define set1 PARALLEL")
modparam("db_virtual", "db_urls", "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost
/testa")
modparam("db_virtual", "db_urls", "postgres://opensips:opensipsrw@localh
ost/opensips")

modparam("db_virtual", "db_urls", "define set2 FAILOVER")
modparam("db_virtual", "db_urls", "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost
/testa")
...

1.3.2.  db_probe_time (integer)

   Time interval after which a registered timer process attempts
   to check failed(as reported by other processes) connections to
   real dbs. The probe will connect and disconnect to the failed
   real db and announce others.

   Default value is 10 (10 sec).

   Example 1.2. Set db_probe_time parameter
...
modparam("db_virtual", "db_probe_time", 20)
...

1.3.3.  db_max_consec_retrys (integer)

   After the timer process has reported that it can connect to the
   real db, other processes will try to reconnect to it. There are
   cases where although the probe could connect some might fail.
   This parameter represents the number of consecutive failed
   retries that a process will do before it gives up. This value
   is reset and suppressed by a MI function(db_set).

   Default value is 10 (10 consecutive times).

   Example 1.3. Set db_max_consec_retrys parameter
...
modparam("db_virtual", "db_max_consec_retrys", 20)
...


1.4. Exported MI Functions

1.4.1.  db_get

   Return information about global state of the real dbs.

   Name: db_get

   Parameters:
     * None.

   MI FIFO Command Format:
                db_get
                _empty_line_

1.4.2.  db_set

   Sets the permissions for real dbs access per set per db.

   Sets the reconnect reset flag.

   Name: db_set

   Parameters:
     * set_index [int]
     * db_url_index [int]
     * may_use_db_flag [boolean]
     * ignore db_max_consec_retrys[boolean](optional)

   db_set 3 2 0 1 means:
     * 3 - the fourth set (must exist)
     * 2 - the third url in the fourth set(must exist)
     * 0 - processes are not allowed to use that url
     * 1 - reset and suppress db_max_consec_retrys

   MI FIFO Command Format:
                db_set 3 2 0 1
                _empty_line_
