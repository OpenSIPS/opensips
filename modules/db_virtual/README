1.1. Overview

1.1.1.  The idea

   A virtual DB will expose the same front DB api however, it will
   backed by many real DB. This means that a virtual DB URL
   translates to many real DB URLs. This virtual layer also
   enables us to use the real dbs in multiple ways such as:
   parallel, failover(hotswap) and round-robin. Therefore: each
   virtual DB URL with associated real dbs and a way to use(mode)
   it's real dbs must be specified.

1.1.2. Modes

   The implemented modes are:
     * FAILOVER
       Use the first URL; if it fails, take the next URL and redo
       the operation.
     * PARALLEL
       Use all the URLs in the virtual DB URL set. Fails if all
       the URLs fail.
     * ROUND (round-robin)
       Use the next URL each time; if it fails, use the next one,
       redo operation.

   When choosing the db virtual mode, be sure that there is a full
   compatibility between the DB operations you want to do
   (inserts, updates, deletes,...) and the relation (if any)
   between the real DB URLs you have in the set - can be
   completely independent, can be nodes of the same cluster, or
   any other combination.

1.1.3. Capabilities

   For each set (or new virtual DB URL), the capabilities are
   automatically calculated based on the capabilities provided by
   the real DB URLs from the set. A logical AND is done for each
   cabability over all the URLs in the set. Shortly, in order for
   the virtual URL to provide a certain capability, ALL its real
   URLs must provide that capability.

   Note that starting with version 2.2 db_virtual supports
   async_raw_query and async_raw_resume functions currently
   implemented only by the mysql database engine.

1.1.4.  Failures

        When an operation from a process on a real DB fails:
                it is marked (global and local CAN flag down)
                its connection closed

        Later a timer process (probe):
        foreach virtual db_url
                foreach real db_url
                        if global CAN down
                                try to connect
                        if ok
                                global CAN up
                                close connection

        Later each process:
                if local CAN down and global CAN up
                        if db_max_consec_retrys *
                                try to connect
                if ok
                        local CAN up


   Note *: there could be inconsistencies between the probe and
   each process so a retry limit is in order. It is reset and
   ignored by an MI command.

1.1.5. The timer process

   The timer process(probe) is a process that tries to reconnect
   to failed dbs from time to time. It is a separate process so
   that when it blocks (for a timeout on the connection) it
   doesn't matter.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * At least one real DB module.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1.  db_URLs (str)

   Multiple value parameter used for virtual DB URLs declaration.

   Example 1.1. Set db_URLs parameter
...

modparam("group","db_URL","virtual://set1")
modparam("presence|presence_xml", "db_URL","virtual://set2")

modparam("db_virtual", "db_URLs", "define set1 PARALLEL")
modparam("db_virtual", "db_URLs", "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost
/testa")
modparam("db_virtual", "db_URLs", "postgres://opensips:opensipsrw@localh
ost/opensips")

modparam("db_virtual", "db_URLs", "define set2 FAILOVER")
modparam("db_virtual", "db_URLs", "mysql://opensips:opensipsrw@localhost
/testa")
...

1.3.2.  db_probe_time (integer)

   Time interval after which a registered timer process attempts
   to check failed(as reported by other processes) connections to
   real dbs. The probe will connect and disconnect to the failed
   real DB and announce others.

   Default value is 10 (10 sec).

   Example 1.2. Set db_probe_time parameter
...
modparam("db_virtual", "db_probe_time", 20)
...

1.3.3.  db_max_consec_retrys (integer)

   After the timer process has reported that it can connect to the
   real db, other processes will try to reconnect to it. There are
   cases where although the probe could connect some might fail.
   This parameter represents the number of consecutive failed
   retries that a process will do before it gives up. This value
   is reset and suppressed by a MI function(db_set).

   Default value is 10 (10 consecutive times).

   Example 1.3. Set db_max_consec_retrys parameter
...
modparam("db_virtual", "db_max_consec_retrys", 20)
...


1.4. Exported MI Functions

1.4.1.  db_get

   Return information about global state of the real dbs.

   Name: db_get

   Parameters:
     * None.

   MI FIFO Command Format:
                                db_get
                                _empty_line_

1.4.2.  db_set

   Sets the permissions for real dbs access per set per db.

   Sets the reconnect reset flag.

   Name: db_set

   Parameters:
     * set_index [int]
     * db_URL_index [int]
     * may_use_db_flag [boolean]
     * ignore db_max_consec_retrys[boolean](optional)

   db_set 3 2 0 1 means:
     * 3 - the fourth set (must exist)
     * 2 - the third URL in the fourth set(must exist)
     * 0 - processes are not allowed to use that URL
     * 1 - reset and suppress db_max_consec_retrys

   MI FIFO Command Format:
                                db_set 3 2 0 1
                                _empty_line_
