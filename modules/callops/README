Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module provides a set of functions that allow the user to
   control ongoing calls. It can be used to trigger a call (either
   blind or attended) transfer, or put a call on hold from the
   proxy side, rather than the end-device side. The module binds
   on top of the OpenSIPS Dialog module to get information about
   the ongoing calls, as well as storing information about new
   calls that will be started.

   The module also triggers a set of events over Event Interface,
   providing to external applications details about how calls are
   being transferred, and how they link between them. These events
   can be used to track down all the legs involved in a call
   transfer.

   One of the biggest challenge when doing Call Transfer scenarios
   is linking new calls to the old calls being transferred,
   especially in blind call transfer scenarios. In order to solve
   this challenge, the module can be configured to refer old legs
   in two different modes, changeable using the mode parameter:
     * Automatically (default mode), by adding a special parameter
       to the destination URI that is being sent in the REFER.
       When the new call comes back, the parameter will be present
       in the Request URI of the new call. The module will find
       it, link the new call to the old call, and remove the
       parameter from the URI.
     * Manually, by using custom/external logic (such as a
       database, or local storage), to match the old call. In this
       mode, the user has to explicitly call the
       call_blind_replace() function to link the two calls
       together.

   The module can also be used to catch Notify refer events and
   reply to them from the OpenSIPS level. However, note that in
   auto mode even if the NOTIFY is handled when the dialog is
   matched, the request will still continue its execution of the
   script, unlike when manual mode is used with the
   call_transfer_notify() function. In order to avoid sending the
   NOTIFY to the end-point, you have to drop it, like below:

   Example 1.1. Drop automatically handled NOTIFY refer events
...
if (has_totag() && loose_route() &&
                is_method("NOTIFY") && $hdr(Event) == "refer")
        drop;
...

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * TM - Transaction module.
     * Dialog - Dialog module for keeping track of the proxied
       calls.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. mode (string)

   This parameter can be used to change the mode that the module
   uses to match a transferred leg. Supported values are:
     * param - when doing a blind transfer, the destination sent
       in the refer message will contain a parameter used to
       identify the dialog that is being replaced. this parameter
       will be automatically removed when the new call is
       received.
     * manual - the user will create its own logic to match the
       new calls, and will call the call_blind_replace() function
       to make OpenSIPS aware of the pair. Note that this mode
       does not handle automatically the Notify refer either, so
       you also have to use the call_transfer_notify() function to
       handle them.
     * callid - similar to the param value, except that instead of
       storing in the Request URI the dialog id of the call to be
       transfered, the actual callid is used as identifier.

   Default value is “auto mode using parameters”.

   Example 1.2. Set mode parameter
...
modparam("callops", "mode", "manual") # use your own logic
...

1.3.2. match_param (string)

   The parameter used to match the different calls together. This
   is mainly using in the param mode, but it is also used
   internally to store different values inside the transferred
   dialog - make sure it does not overlap with existing dialog
   values.

   Default value is “osid”.

   Example 1.3. Set match_param parameter
...
modparam("callops", "match_param", "call")
...

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  call_blind_replace(callid[, leg])

   When manual mode is used, this function is called to create a
   mapping between the transferring call and the transferred call.
   It should be called when OpenSIPS receives a new call that is
   transferring an existing call.

   Parameters:
     * callid (string) - the existing call that is being
       transferred.
     * leg (string, optional) - the leg that is being transferred.
       If not specified, and OpenSIPS cannot determine the leg
       based on its destination, the unknown tag should be used.

   This function can be used only from a request route.

   Example 1.4. Use call_blind_replace() function to match an
   existing leg.
...
if (!has_totag() && is_method("INVITE")) {
        if (cache_fetch("local", "callid_$si", $avp(callid))) {
                call_blind_replace($avp(callid));
        }
}
...

1.4.2.  call_transfer_notify()

   When manual mode is used, this function should be called on
   in-dialog NOTIFY requests for an Event: refer header, to handle
   them accordingly.

   Note that if the function successfully handles the NOTIFY
   request, the script no longer continues its execution.

   This function can be used from a request route, failure route
   and local route.

   Example 1.5. Use call_transfer_notify() function to handle
   NOTIFY refer requests.
...
if (has_totag() && is_method("NOTIFY") && loose_route()) {
        call_transfer_notify();
}
...

1.4.3.  call_transfer(leg, destination) or

   This function triggers a blind call transfer by sending a REFER
   message during an ongoing call. The function needs to be run
   inside the context of the dialog you are transferring.

   Parameters:
     * leg (string) - the leg that is being transferred. Must be
       one of the caller or callee values.
     * destination (string) - SIP URI of the destination where the
       leg is being transferred.

   This function can be used from any route that has a dialog
   context.

   Example 1.6. Use call_transfer() function to do a blind
   transfer of the caller to a new destination.
...
if (has_totag() && && loose_route()) {
        call_transfer("caller", "sip:announcement@127.0.0.1");
}
...

1.4.4.  call_transfer(leg, transfer_callid, transfer_leg[,
destination]) or

   This function triggers an attended call transfer by sending a
   REFER message during an ongoing call. The function needs to be
   run inside the context of the dialog you are transferring.

   Parameters:
     * leg (string) - the leg that is being transferred. Must be
       one of the caller or callee values.
     * transfer_callid (string) - the callid of the second dialog
       that is being transferred.
     * transfer_leg (string) - the leg within the second call that
       will be transferred to leg. Must be one of the caller or
       callee values.
     * destination (string, optional) - SIP URI of the destination
       where the leg is being transferred. If missing, the From/To
       URI of the initial call are used.

   This function can be used from any route that has a dialog
   context.

   Example 1.7. Use call_transfer() function to do an attended
   transfer of the caller to the callee of a different call.
...
if (has_totag() && && loose_route()) {
        call_transfer("caller", "ba55b1b3-459d-4e84-a6f8-14c40e4f6ace",
"callee");
}
...

1.5. Exported MI Functions

1.5.1.  call_transfer

   MI command to transfer an ongoing call to a new destination.

   Depending on the parameters used, this command can do both
   blind and attended transfers scenarios. When the
   transfer_callid is used, then an attended transfer is
   performed, other wise a blind transfer is issued.

   Name: call_transfer

   Parameters
     * callid (string) - the callid of the dialog that is being
       transferred.
     * leg (string) - indicates the leg of the callid call that is
       being transferred/kept in the new transferring call.
       Possible values are “caller”, “callee” or “both”.
     * destination (string, optional) - the URI where the call is
       being transferred. This parameter is mandatory for blind
       transfers, and optional for attended transfers. In the case
       of an attended transfer, if it is missing, the destination
       of the call is taken from the URIs in the transfer dialog.
     * transfer_callid (string, optional) - mandatory in case of
       an attended transfer, to specify the call of the Bleg in
       the new call.
     * transfer_leg (string, optional) - in case of an attended
       transfer, it specifies the participant of the
       transfer_callid call that will be bridged with the leg of
       the callid. If missing, transfer_fromtag and transfer_totag
       must be used to identify the tag.
     * transfer_fromtag and transfer_totag (string, optional) -
       these parameters should always be specified together, and
       are used in call attended transfer scenarios where the
       dialog of the Bleg that is being transferred is not managed
       by OpenSIPS. Note that for these scenarios only the A-leg
       dialog will receive events about the call transfer.

   MI FIFO Command Format:
# blind transfer to sip:agent@127.0.0.1
opensips-cli -x mi call_transfer \
        callid=4b664b48-5639-40bf-bff8-3a866c145c3b \
        leg=caller \
        destination=sip:agent@217.0.0.1

# attended transfer between two calls
opensips-cli -x mi call_transfer \
        callid=e8d024db-78e5-4d18-9794-5b8ba837bed4
        leg=caller \

   on hold. If the call is already on hold, an error is returned.

   Name: call_hold

   Parameters
     * callid (string) - the callid of the dialog that is being
       put on hold.

   MI FIFO Command Format:

1.5.3.  call_unhold

   MI command to resume a call from an onhold state put by the
   call_hold call.

   Command returns OK if any of the legs are resumed, or an error
   if no leg had been previously put on hold.

   Name: call_unhold

   Parameters
     * callid (string) - the callid of the dialog that is being
       resumed.

   MI FIFO Command Format:
opensips-cli -x mi call_unhold \

1.6. Exported Events

1.6.1.  E_CALL_TRANSFER

   This event is triggered during a call transfer scenario.

   For a specific call transfer, multiple events are triggered,
   starting when the transfer is initiated, until the transfer is
   completed. The state parameter indicates the state of the call
   transfer.

   For a blind transfer scenario, only one set of events are
   triggered, whereas for attended transfer, you will get a set of
   events for both dialogs involved in the transfer, as long as
   both are proxied through OpenSIPS

   Parameters:
     * callid - the callid of the call that is being transferred.
     * leg - the leg (caller or callee) of the call that is being
       transferred.
     * transfer_callid - the callid of the new call that is
       transferring the old callid call.
     * destination - the URI destination where the leg is being
       transferred.
     * state - the state of the transfer:
          + start - triggered when the REFER message is being sent
            out to the transferred participant.
          + notify - triggered when a NOTIFY refer event is
            received from the transferred participant. The status
            parameter contains extra information about the status
            of the transferring call.
          + ok - triggered when the transfer is completed - the
            call is answered by the transferred participant.
          + fail - triggered when a transfer has failed due to
            various reasons. If we were unable to start the call
            transfer (i.e. send the REFER), the status parameter
            is empty, otherwise it contains information about the
            failure.
     * status - contains extra information about the success or
       failure of the call.

1.6.2.  E_CALL_HOLD

   Triggered during the process of putting a call on hold, or
   resuming a call from an on hold state.

   This event is triggered twice per each leg of the call - first
   when the leg starts to be put on hold, and then when the leg
   accepts or rejects the state.

   Parameters:
     * callid - the callid of the call that is being put on hold,
       or resumed.
     * leg - the leg (caller or callee) affected by the call on
       hold, or resumed.
     * action - hold or unhold action that is being performed.
     * state - the state of the action that is being performed.
          + start - triggered when the re-INVITE is being sent out
            to the participant being put on hold.
          + ok - triggered when the on hold/resume action is
            successfully completed.
          + fail - triggered when the action failed.
