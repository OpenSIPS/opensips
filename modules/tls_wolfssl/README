Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module implements TLS operations using the wolfssl
   libarary and provides an interface for the proto_bins module.
   The wolfssl library is statically-linked and bundled with this
   module so no installation or external dependency is required.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. ca_list (string)

   List of trusted CAs. The file contains the certificates
   accepted, one after the other. It MUST be a file, not a folder.

   Default value is "".

   Example 1.1. Set ca_list variable
...
modparam("wolfssl", "ca_list", "/mycerts/certs/ca_list.pem")
...

1.3.2. certificate (string)

   Public certificate file for OpenSIPS. It will be used as
   server-side certificate for incoming TLS connections, and as a
   client-side certificate for outgoing TLS connections.

   Default value is "".

   Example 1.2. Set certificate variable
...
modparam("wolfssl", "certificate", "/mycerts/certs/opensips_server_cert.
pem")
...

1.3.3. private_key (string)

   Private key of the above certificate. I must be kept in a safe
   place with tight permissions!

   Default value is "".

   Example 1.3. Set private_key variable
...
modparam("wolfssl", "private_key", "/mycerts/private/prik.pem")
...

   (1) DevScore = author_commits + author_lines_added /
   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files
