		</question>
		<answer>
		<para>
		Make sure you've upgraded the Redis "libhiredis" client library to at
		least version 0.14.1.  There was at least one significant vulnerability
		reported in library versions prior to that one (<ulink url="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-7105">CVE-2020-7105</ulink>),
		so upgrading to latest stable may very well fix the crash!
