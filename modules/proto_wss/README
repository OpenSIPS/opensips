Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The WSS (Secure WebSocket) module provides the ability to
   communicate with a WebSocket (RFC 6455) client or server over a
   secure (TLS encrypted) channel. As part of the WebRTC
   specifications, this protocol can be used to provide secure
   VoIP calls to HTTPS enabled browsers.

   This module behaves as any other transport protocol module: in
   order to use it, you must define one or more listeners that
   will handle the secure WebSocket traffic, after the mpath
   parameter:

...
mpath=/path/to/modules
...
socket=wss:10.0.0.1                     # change with the listening IP
socket=wss:10.0.0.1:5060        # change with the listening IP and port
...

   Besides that, you need to define the TLS parameters for
   securing the connection. This is done through the tls_mgm
   module interface, similar to the proto_tls module:

modparam("tls_mgm", "certificate", "/certs/biloxy.com/cert.pem")
modparam("tls_mgm", "private_key", "/certs/biloxy.com/privkey.pem")
modparam("tls_mgm", "ca_list", "/certs/wellknownCAs")
modparam("tls_mgm", "tls_method", "tlsv1")
modparam("tls_mgm", "verify_cert", "1")
modparam("tls_mgm", "require_cert", "1")

   Check the tls_mgm module documentation for more info.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * tls_mgm.

1.2.2. Dependencies of external libraries

   OpenSIPS TLS v1.0 support requires the following packages:
     * openssl or libssl >= 0.9.6
     * openssl-dev or libssl-dev

   OpenSIPS TLS v1.1/1.2 support requires the following packages:
     * openssl or libssl >= 1.0.1e
     * openssl-dev or libssl-dev

1.3. Exported Parameters

   All these parameters can be used from the opensips.cfg file, to
   configure the behavior of OpenSIPS-WSS.

1.3.1. listen=interface

   This is a global parameter that specifies what interface/IP and
   port should handle WSS traffic.

   Example 1.1. Set listen variable
...
socket= wss:1.2.3.4:44344
...

1.3.2. wss_port (integer)

   The default port to be used for all WSS related operation. Be
   careful as the default port impacts both the SIP listening part
   (if no port is defined in the WSS listeners) and the SIP
   sending part (if the destination WSS URI has no explicit port).

   If you want to change only the listening port for WSS, use the
   port option in the SIP listener defintion.

   Default value is 443.

   Example 1.2. Set wss_port variable
...
modparam("proto_wss", "wss_port", 44344)
...

1.3.3. wss_max_msg_chunks (integer)

   The maximum number of chunks in which a SIP message is expected
   to arrive via WSS. If a received packet is more fragmented than
   this, the connection is dropped (either the connection is very
   overloaded and this leads to high fragmentation - or we are the
   victim of an ongoing attack where the attacker is sending very
   fragmented traffic in order to decrease server performance).

   Default value is 4.

   Example 1.3. Set wss_max_msg_chunks parameter
...
modparam("proto_wss", "wss_max_msg_chunks", 8)
...

1.3.4. wss_resource (string)

   The resource queried for when a WebSocket handshake is
   initiated.

   Default value is “/”.

   Example 1.4. Set wss_resource parameter
...
modparam("proto_wss", "wss_resource", "/wss")
...

1.3.5. wss_handshake_timeout (integer)

   This parameter specifies the time in milliseconds the proto_wss
   module waits for a WebSocket handshake reply from a WebSocket
   server.

   Default value is 100.

   Example 1.5. Set wss_handshake_timeout parameter
...
modparam("proto_wss", "wss_handshake_timeout", 300)
...

1.3.6. cert_check_on_conn_reusage (integer)

   This parameter turns on or off the extra checking/matching of
   the TLS domain (SSL certificate) when comes to reusing an
   existing TLS connection. Without this extra check, only IP and
   port of the connections will be check (in order to re-use an
   existing connection). With this extra check, the connection to
   be reused must have the same SSL certificate as the one set for
   the current signaling operation.

   This checking is done only when comes to send SIP traffic via
   TLS and it is applied only against connections that were
   created / initiated by OpenSIPS (as TLS client). Any accepte
   connection (as TLS server) will automatically match (the extra
   test will be skipped).

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.6. Set cert_check_on_conn_reusage parameter
...
modparam("proto_wss", "cert_check_on_conn_reusage", 1)
...

1.3.7. trace_destination (string)

   Trace destination as defined in the tracing module. Currently
   the only tracing module is proto_hep. Network events such as
   connect, accept and connection closed events shall be traced
   along with errors that could appear in the process. For each
   connection that is created an event containing information
   about the client and server certificate, master key, http
   request and reply belonging to web socket protocol handshake
   and network layer information shall be sent.

   WARNING: A tracing module must be loaded in order for this
   parameter to work. (for example proto_hep).

   Default value is none(not defined).

   Example 1.7. Set trace_destination parameter
...
modparam("proto_hep", "trace_destination", "[hep_dest]10.0.0.2;transport
=tcp;version=3")

modparam("proto_wss", "trace_destination", "hep_dest")
...

1.3.8. trace_on (int)

   This controls whether tracing for wss is on or not. You still
   need to define trace_destinationin order to work, but this
   value will be controlled using mi function wss_trace.
   Default value is 0(tracing inactive).

   Example 1.8. Set trace_on parameter
...
modparam("proto_wss", "trace_on", 1)
...

1.3.9. trace_filter_route (string)

   Define the name of a route in which you can filter which
   connections will be trace and which connections won't be. In
   this route you will have information regarding source and
   destination ips and ports for the current connection. To
   disable tracing for a specific connection the last call in this
   route must be drop, any other exit mode resulting in tracing
   the current connection ( of course you still have to define a
   trace_destination and trace must be on at the time this
   connection is opened.

   IMPORTANT Filtering on ip addresses and ports can be made using
   $si and $sp for matching either the entity that is connecting
   to OpenSIPS or the entity to which OpenSIPS is connecting. The
   name might be misleading ( $si meaning the source ip if you
   read the docs) but in reality it is simply the socket other
   than the OpenSIPS socket. In order to match OpenSIPS interface
   (either the one that accepted the connection or the one that
   initiated a connection) $socket_in(ip) (ip) and
   $socket_in(port) (port) can be used.

   WARNING: IF trace_on is set to 0 or tracing is deactived via
   the mi command wss_trace this route won't be called.
   Default value is none(no route is set).

   Example 1.9. Set trace_filter_route parameter
...
modparam("proto_wss", "trace_filter_route", "wss_filter")
...
/* all wss connections will go through this route if tracing is activate
d
 * and a trace destination is defined */
route[wss_filter] {
        ...
        /* all connections opened from/by ip 1.1.1.1:8000 will be traced
           on interface 1.1.1.10:5060(opensips listener)
           all the other connections won't be */
         if ( $si == "1.1.1.1" && $sp == 8000 &&
                $socket_in(ip) == "1.1.1.10"  && $socket_in(port) == 506
0)
                exit;
        else
                drop;
}
...

1.3.10. wss_tls_handshake_timeout (integer)

   Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) for the SSL handshake
   sequence to complete. It may be necessary to increase this
   value when using a CPU intensive cipher for the connection to
   allow time for keys to be generated and processed.

   The timeout is invoked during acceptance of a new connection
   (inbound) and during the wait period when a new session is
   being initiated (outbound).

   Default value is 100.

   Example 1.10. Set wss_tls_handshake_timeout variable

param("proto_wss", "wss_tls_handshake_timeout", 200) # number of millise
conds


1.3.11. wss_send_timeout (integer)

   Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) for the send operations to
   complete

   The send timeout is invoked for all TLS write operations,
   excluding the handshake process (see:
   wss_tls_handshake_timeout)

   Default value is 100.

   Example 1.11. Set wss_send_timeout variable

aram("proto_wss", "wss_send_timeout", 200) # number of milliseconds
