Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The Sangoma transcoding module offers the possibility of
   performing voice transcoding with the D-series transcoding
   cards manufactured by Sangoma. The module makes use of the
   Sangoma Transcoding API in order to manage transcoding sessions
   on the dedicated equipment. For the cards in the network to be
   detected, the Sangoma SOAP server must be up and running
   (sngtc_server daemon).

1.2. How it works

   The module performs several modifications in the SDP body of
   SIP INVITE, 200 OK and ACK messages. In all transcoding
   scenarios, the UAC performs early SDP negotiation, while the
   UAS does late negotiation. This way, OpenSIPS becomes
   responsible for intersecting the codec offer and answer,
   together with the management of transcoding sessions on the
   Sangoma cards.

   This scenario brings about a couple of restrictions:
     * UACs MUST only perform early SDP negotiation
     * UASs MUST support late SDP negotiation (rfc 3261
       requirement)

   Since the sngtc_node library performs several memory
   allocations with each newly created transcoding session, the
   module uses a dedicated process, responsible for the management
   of the above-mentioned sessions. The sangoma_worker process
   communicates with the OpenSIPS UDP receivers through a series
   of pipes.

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * dialog.

1.3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * sngtc_node library - download from Sangoma, unpack, make,
       make install (required in order to compile this module).
     * sngtc_server up and running (required in order for this
       module to properly work).

1.4. Exported Functions

1.4.1.  sngtc_offer()

   The function strips off the SDP offer from a SIP INVITE, thus
   asking for another SDP offer from the opposite endpoint (late
   negotiation).

   The following error codes may be returned:
     * -1 - SDP parsing error
     * -3 - internal error / no more memory

   The function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.1. sngtc_offer usage
...
        if (is_method("INVITE")) {
                t_newtran();
                create_dialog();
                sngtc_offer();
        }
...

1.4.2.  sngtc_callee_answer([listen_if_A], [listen_if_B])

   Handles the SDP offer from 200 OK responses, intersects both
   offers with the capabilities of the transcoding card and
   creates a new transcoding session on the card only if
   necessary. It then rewrites the 200 OK SDP so that it contains
   the information resulted from the codec intersection.

   Parameters explained:

   Since the D-series transcoding cards are connected through
   either a PCI slot or simply an Ethernet connector, they cannot
   be assigned global IPs. Consequently, the module will write the
   local, private IP of the card in the SDP answers sent to each
   of the endpoints. Since this will not work with non-local UAs,
   the optional parameters force the RTP listen interface for each
   UA. This way, the script writer can enforce a global IP for the
   incoming RTP (which can be port forwarded to a transcoding
   card).
     * listen_if_A (string) - the interface where the UAC (the
       caller) will send RTP after the call is established (IP
       from the 'c=' SDP line(s))
     * listen_if_B (string) - the interface where the UAS (the
       callee) will send RTP after the call is established (IP
       from the 'c=' SDP line(s))

   The following error codes may be returned:
     * -1 - SDP parsing error
     * -2 - failed to create transcoding session
     * -3 - internal error / no more memory

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.2. sngtc_callee_answer usage
...
onreply_route[1] {
        if ($rs == 200)
                sngtc_callee_answer("11.12.13.14", "11.12.13.14");
}
...

1.4.3.  sngtc_caller_answer()

   Attaches an SDP body to the caller's ACK request, so that it
   matches the late SDP negotiation done by the UAS.

   The following error codes may be returned:
     * -3 - internal error / no more memory

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE, ONREPLY_ROUTE.

   Example 1.3. sngtc_caller_answer usage
...
        if (has_totag()) {
                if (loose_route()) {
                        ...
                        if (is_method("ACK"))
                                sngtc_caller_answer();
                }
                ...
        }
...
