Chapter 1. User's Guide

1.1. Overview

   This is a module which provides Oracle connectivity for
   OpenSIPS. It implements the DB API defined in OpenSIPS. If you
   want to use the nathelper module, or any other modules that
   calls the get_all_ucontacts API export from usrloc, then you
   need to set the DORACLE_USRLOC define in the Makefile.defs file
   before compilation.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * No dependencies on other OpenSIPS modules.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * instantclient-sdk-10.2.0.3 - the development headers and
       libraries of OCI.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. timeout (fixedpoint)

   Timeout value for any operation with BD.

   Possible values is from 0.1 to 10.0 seconds.

   Default value is 3.0 (3 second).

   If value of timeout parameter set to 0, module use synchronous
   mode (without timeout).

   Example 1.1. Set timeout parameter
...
modparam("db_oracle", "timeout", 1.5)
...

   Example 1.2. Disable asynchronous mode
...
modparam("db_oracle", "timeout", 0)
...

1.3.2. reconnect (fixedpoint)

   Timeout value for connect (create session) operation.

   Possible values is from 0.1 to 10.0 seconds.

   Default value is 0.2 (200 milliseconds).

   Example 1.3. Set reconnect parameter
...
modparam("db_oracle", "reconnect", 0.5)
...

1.4. Exported Functions

   No function exported to be used from configuration file.

1.5. Installation

   Because it dependes on an external library, the oracle module
   is not compiled and installed by default. You can use one of
   the next options.
     * - edit the "Makefile" and remove "db_oracle" from
       "excluded_modules" list. Then follow the standard procedure
       to install OpenSIPS: "make all; make install".
     * - from command line use: 'make all
       include_modules="db_oracle"; make install
       include_modules="db_oracle"'.

1.6. Utility opensips_orasel

   For working with opensips-cli tool, should be able to print the
   'query' results to the terminal in a user-readable form. The
   standard command-line Oracle client (sqlplus) is not quite
   suitable for this, as it cannot align row width to real
   (received) data's (it always prints a cell width as described
   in the db scheme). This problem has been solved by inclusion
   the utility opensips_orasel, which formats printing
   approximately in the same way as the 'mysql' client utility. In
   addition, this utility known about the "agreements and types"
   in DB that are used in OpenSIPS for the work with Oracle and
   formats printing taking these into account.

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".
