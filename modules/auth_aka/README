Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module contains functions that are used to perform digest
   authentication using the AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement)
   security protocol. This mechanism is being used in IMS networks
   to provide mutual authentication between the UE (device) and
   the 3G/4G/5G network.

   The AKA protocol establishes a set of security keys, called
   authentication vectors (or AVs), and uses them to generate the
   digest challenge, as well as for computing the digest result
   and authenticating the UE. AVs are exchanged over a separate
   communication channel.

   Although the AKA protocol also requires to use the AVs to
   establish a secure channel between the UE and the network (by
   means of IPSec tunnels), this module does not handle that part
   - it just performs the authentication of the user and passes
   along the cyphering and integrity keys in the Authorization
   header, according to the ETSI TS 129 229 specifications. These
   are later on picked up by other components (such as P-CSCFs) to
   establish the secure channel.

1.2. Authentication Vectors

   Authentication Vectors (or AVs) consist of a set of five
   parameter (RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK, IK) that are being used for
   mutual authentication. As these need to be exchanged between
   the device (UE) and network through a different channel (i.e.
   Diameter Cx interface in LTE networks), the module does not
   provide any means to fetch the AV information. It does,
   however, provide a generic interface (called AV Manage
   Interface) to store AVs (that are being fetched by other
   modules/channels), manage them and use them in the digest
   authentication algorithm.

   Basic AV operations that the module performs:
     * Ask for a new AV to be fetched for a specific user identity
     * Manage an AV lifetime, including reuses
     * Mark an AV as being used in a digest challeng
     * Invalidate or discard an AV (due to various reasons)

   A module that implements the AV Manage Interface (called AV
   Manager) should be able to fetch all five parameters of an AV,
   and push them in the AV Storage.

1.3. Supported algorithms

   The current implementation only supports the AKAv1 algorithms,
   with the associated hashing functions (such as MD5, SHA-256).
   In the challenge message, we send, one can advertise other
   algorithms as well, but the response cannot be handled by this
   module, and an appropriate error will be returned.

1.4. Dependencies

1.4.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other words
   the listed modules must be loaded before this module):
     * auth -- Authentication framework
     * AV manage module -- at least one module that fetches AVs
       and pushes them in the AV storage

1.4.2. External Libraries or Applications

   This module does not depend on any external library.

1.5. Exported Parameters

1.5.1. default_av_mgm (string)

   The default AV Manager used in case the functions do not
   provide them explicitly.

   Example 1.1. default_av_mgm parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "default_av_mgm", "diameter") # fetch AVs through t
he Cx interface

1.5.2. default_qop (string)

   The default qop parameter used during challenge, if the
   functions do not provide them explicitly.

   Default value is auth.

   Example 1.2. default_qop parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "default_qop", "auth,auth-int")

1.5.3. default_algorithm (string)

   The default algorithm to be advertise during challenge, if the
   functions do not provide them explicitly. Note that at least
   one of the algorithms provided should be an AKA one, otherwise
   it makes no sense to use this module.

   Default value is AKAv1-MD5.

   WARNING: only AKAv1* algorithms are currently supported.

   Example 1.3. default_algorithm parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "default_algorithm", "AKAv2-MD5")

1.5.4. hash_size (integer)

   The size of the hash that stores the AVs for each user. Must be
   a power of 2 number.

   Default value is 4096.

   Example 1.4. hash_size parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "hash_size", 1024)

1.5.5. sync_timeout (integer)

   The amount of milliseconds a synchronous call should wait for
   getting an authentication vector.

   Must be a positive value. A value of 0 indicates to wait
   indefinitely.

   Default value is 100 ms.

   Example 1.5. sync_timeout parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "sync_timeout", 200)

1.5.6. async_timeout (integer)

   The amount of milliseconds an asynchronous call should wait for
   getting an authentication vector.

   Must be a positive value, greater than 0.

   NOTE: the current timeout mechanism only has seconds
   granularity, therefore you should configure this parameter as a
   multiple of 1000.

   Default value is 1000 ms.

   Example 1.6. async_timeout parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "async_timeout", 2000)

1.5.7. unused_timeout (integer)

   The amount of seconds an authentication vector that has not
   been used can stay in memory. Once this timeout is reached, the
   authentication vector is removed.

   Must be a positive value, greater than 0.

   Default value is 60 s.

   Example 1.7. unused_timeout parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "unused_timeout", 120)

1.5.8. unused_timeout (integer)

   The amount of seconds an authentication vector that is being
   used in the authentication process shall stay in memory. Once
   this timeout is reached, the authentication vector is removed,
   and the authentication using it will fail.

   Must be a positive value, greater than 0.

   Default value is 30 s.

   Example 1.8. pending_timeout parameter usage

modparam("auth_aka", "pending_timeout", 10)

1.6. Exported Functions

1.6.1. aka_www_authorize([realm]])

   The function verifies credentials according to RFC3310, by
   using an authentication vector priorly allocated by an
   aka_www_challenge() call, using the av_mgm manager. If the
   credentials are verified successfully the function will
   succeed, otherwise it will fail with an appropriate error code,
   as follows:
     * -6 (sync request) - the auts parameter was was present,
       thus a sync was requested;
     * -5 (generic error) - some generic error occurred and no
       reply was sent out;
     * -4 (no credentials) - credentials were not found in
       request;
     * -3 (unknown nonce) - authentication vector with the
       corresponding nonce was not found;
     * -2 (invalid password) - password does not match the
       authentication vector;
     * -1 (invalid username) - no username found in the Authorize
       header;

   In case the function succeeds, the WWW-Authenticate header is
   being added to the reply, containing the challenge information,
   as well as the Integrity-Key and the Confidentiality-Key values
   associated to the AV being used.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * realm (string) - Realm is a opaque string that the user
       agent should present to the user so he can decide what
       username and password to use. This is usually one of the
       domains the proxy is responsible for. If an empty string “”
       is used then the server will generate realm from host part
       of From header field URI.

   If the credentials are verified successfully then the function
   will succeed and mark the credentials as authorized (marked
   credentials can be later used by some other functions).

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.9. aka_www_authorize usage

...
if (!aka_www_authorize("diameter", "siphub.com"))
        aka_www_challenge("diameter", "siphub.com", "auth");
...


1.6.2. aka_proxy_authorize([realm]])

   The function behaves the same as aka_www_authorize(), but it
   authenticates the user from a proxy perspective. It receives
   the same parameters, with the same meaning, and returns the
   same values.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.10. aka_proxy_authorize usage

...
if (!aka_proxy_authorize("siphub.com"))
        aka_proxy_challenge("diameter", "siphub.com", "auth");
...


1.6.3. aka_www_challenge([av_mgm[, realm[ ,qop[, alg]]]])

   The function challenges a user agent. It fetches an
   authentication vector for each algorigthm used through the
   av_mgm Manager and generate one or more WWW-Authenticate header
   fields containing digest challenges. It will put the header
   field(s) into a response generated from the request the server
   is processing and will send the reply. Upon reception of such a
   reply the user agent should compute credentials using the used
   authentication vector annd retry the request. For more
   information regarding digest authentication see RFC2617,
   RFC3261, RFC3310 and RFC8760.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * av_mgm (string, optional) - the AV Manager to be used for
       this challenge, in case an AV is not already available for
       the challenged user identity. In case it is missing the
       value of the default_av_mgm is being used.
       realm (string) - Realm is an opaque string that the user
       agent should present to the user so it can decide what
       username and password to use. Usually this is domain of the
       host the server is running on. If missing, the value of the
       From domain is being used.
     * qop (string, optional) - Value of this parameter can be
       either “auth”, “auth-int” or both (separated by ,). When
       this parameter is set the server will put a qop parameter
       in the challenge. It is recommended to use the qop
       parameter, however there are still some user agents that
       cannot handle qop properly so we made this optional. On the
       other hand there are still some user agents that cannot
       handle request without a qop parameter too. If missing, the
       value of the default_qop is being used.
     * algorithms (string, optional) - Value of this parameter is
       a comma-separated list of digest algorithms to be offered
       for the UAC to use for authentication. Possible values are:
          + “AKAv1-MD5”
          + “AKAv1-MD5-sess”
          + “AKAv1-SHA-256”
          + “AKAv1-SHA-256-sess”
          + “AKAv1-SHA-512-256”
          + “AKAv1-SHA-512-256-sess”
          + “AKAv2-MD5”
          + “AKAv2-MD5-sess”
          + “AKAv2-SHA-256”
          + “AKAv2-SHA-256-sess”
          + “AKAv2-SHA-512-256”
          + “AKAv2-SHA-512-256-sess”
       When the value is empty or not set, the only offered digest
       the value of the default_algorithm is being used.

   Possible return codes:
     * -1 - generic parsing error, generated when there is not
       enoough data to build the challange
     * -2 - no AV vector could not be fetched
     * -3 - authentication headers could not be built
     * -5 - a reply could not be sent
     * positive - the number of successful chalanges being sent in
       the reply; this value can be lower than the number of
       algorithms being requested in case there was a timeout
       waiting for some AVs.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.11. aka_www_challenge usage
...
if (!aka_www_authorize("siphub.com")) {
        aka_www_challenge(,"siphub.com", "auth-int", "AKAv1-MD5");
}
...

1.6.4. aka_proxy_challenge([realm]])

   The function behaves the same as aka_www_challenge(), but it
   challenges the user from a proxy perspective. It receives the
   same parameters, with the same meaning, the only difference
   being that in case of the realm is missing, then it is taken
   from the the To domain, rather than from From domain. The
   header added is Proxy-Authenticate, rather than
   WWW-Authenticate The rest of the parameters, behavior, as well
   as return values are the same.

   This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.

   Example 1.12. aka_proxy_challenge usage

...
if (!aka_proxy_authorize("siphub.com"))
        aka_proxy_challenge(,"siphub.com", "auth");
...


1.6.5. aka_av_add(public_identity, private_identity, authenticate,
authorize, confidentiality_key, integrity_key[, algorithms])

   Adds an authentication vector for the user identitied by
   public_identity and private_identity.

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * public_identity (string) - the public identity (IMPU) of
       the user to add authentication vector for.
     * private_identity (string) - the private identity (IMPI) of
       the user to add authentication vector for.
     * authenticate (string) - the concatenation of the
       authentication challenge RAND and the token AUTN, encoded
       in hexa format.
     * authorize (string) - the authorization string (XRES) used
       for authorizing the user, encoded in hexa format.

     * integrity_key (string) - the Integrity-Key used in the AKA
       IPSec process, encoded in hexa format.
     * algorithms (string, optional) - AKA algorithms this AV
       should be used for. If missing, the AV can be used for any
       AKA algorithm.

   This function can be used from any route.

   Example 1.13. aka_av_add usage

...
aka_av_add("sip:test@siphub.com", "test@siphub.com",
                        "KFQ/MpR3cE3V9PxucEQS5KED8uUNYIAALFyk59sIJI4=",
/* authenticate */

                        "KFQ/MpR3cE3V9PxucEQS5KED8uUNYIAALFyk59sIJI4=");
...

1.6.7. aka_av_drop_all(public_identity, private_identity[, count])

1.7.4. aka_av_fail

   Indicates the fact that the fetching of an authentication
   vector has failed, unlocking the processing of the message.

   Note: this function is useful when you know that fetching a new
   authentication vector is not possible (due to various reasons)
   - calling it will resume the message procesing, using only the
   available AVs fetched so far.

   Parameters:
     * public_identity (string) - the public identity (IMPU) of
       the user to add authentication vector for.
     * private_identity (string) - the private identity (IMPI) of
       the user to add authentication vector for.
     * count (integer, optional) - the number of authentication
       vectors failures.
