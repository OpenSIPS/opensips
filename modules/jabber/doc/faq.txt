Jabber module (SIP*IM Gateway) FAQ
==================================

[   OBSOLETED   ]

1. Description
--------------

1.1 What is SIP to IM Gateway?
A: SIP to IM gateway is a module for SER that allows SIP clients to send/receive
 instant messages to/from other IM networks (like ICQ, AIM, MSN ...).

1.2 How does the gateway work?
A: The gateway uses Jabber server for sending/receiving messages to/from IM
 networks. The modules translate SIP messages to Jabber format and send them to
 Jabber server, which is able to send instant messages across many IM networks.
 Actually, the module is a gateway between SIP and Jabber protocol.

2. End-User questions
---------------------
2.1 What I need to use the gateway?
A: Anyone who wants to use the gateway MUST have a SIP account on 'iptel.org'.
 Next step (IM Gateway registration) consists in registering your IM id for each
 network that you want to communicate with. For this, you have to fill the
 registration form at 'http://www.iptel.org/im/subscribe.php'.

2.2 How can I change my IM accounts from IM gateway?
A: To change the IM account just fill again the subscription for the appropriate
 IM network and press 'Subscribe'.

2.3 How can I remove my IM account from IM gateway?
A: To remove an IM account just select the appropriate IM network and press
 'Unsubscribe'.

2.4 How destination must be set?
A: For each IM network exists a destination address format. Usually is like:
 'user_id@im.iptel.org', where 'im' must be replaced with IM network id (icq,
 aim, msn, yahoo, ...).
Examples:
- ICQ: icq_number@icq.iptel.org
- MSN: user_name%hotmail.com@msn.iptel.org or user_name%msn.com@msn.iptel.org
- AIM: user_name@aim.iptel.org

2.5 How could IM users send messages to SIP users?
A: They must sent messages to the IM id that SIP users have set at IM gateway
 registration.

2.6 I also need a Jabber user id?
A: No, Jabber user associated to you is created on IM gateway registration.
 There is used an internal Jabber server and that avoids Jabber ids conflict.

3. Configuration questions
--------------------------

3.1 How is the gateway started?
A: Load the module in SER, after you have set the right parameters and, also,
 start the jabber server. There should be a file 'imgwd' in subfolder 'etc/' of
 sources that can be used as starting/stopping script (be sure you set the
 correct paths).

3.2 What are the parameters?
A: The parameters are:
- "contact" - contact header of SIM message - if is not set the header is filled
with the content of the 'from' address
- "db_url" - MySQL database url - including user, password, host, port and
database name
- "jaddress" - address (IP or hostname) of the Jabber server
- "jport" - Jabber server port
- "workers" - number of workers
- "max_jobs" - maximum number of jobs per worker
- "cache_time" - time (in seconds) to keep alive a Jabber connection
- "delay_time" - time (in seconds) to keep first messages before sending them to
 Jabber - to avoid the sending before Jabber server connects to IM networks
- "sleep_time" - time (in seconds) between checking for expired connections

4. Technical questions
----------------------

4.1 What SIP IM software clients should be use?
A: Any application that supports SIP for instant messaging. MSN Messager is the
 only one of the well known IM application clients that supports SIP. Other SIP
 IM clients are JSIP and HotSIP.
