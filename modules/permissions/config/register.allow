# Files register.allow and register.deny could be used
# by allow_register function to prevent registration of
# certain IP addresses. This (allow) file is empty because
# we only want to restrict IPs that can be registered and
# therefore we use register.deny file only.
#
# If you have a privileged user that should be able to
# register anything than you might want to uncomment the
# following line. WARNING: Do not uncomment unless you
# really know what are you doing !
