# PERMISSIONS module

Description:
------------

Permissions module is used to determinate if a call has appropriate permission to be established.
Permissions can be menaged in configuraton files simular to hosts.allow and hosts.deny:

The search stops at the first match:
    - Routing will be allowed when a (FROM,TO) pair matches an entry in the /etc/ser/permissions.allow file.
    - Otherwise, routing will be denied when a (FROM,TO) pair matches an entry in the /etc/ser/permissions.deny file.
    - Otherwise, routing will be allowed.

A non-existing permission control file is treated as if it were an empty file.
Thus, permission control can be turned off by providing no permission control files.
	      
FROM and TO headers are always compared with regular expressions! For the syntax see the sample file: config/permissions.allow
