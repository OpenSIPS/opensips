Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module provides access to a database that is implemented
   as a HTTP server. It may be used in special cases where
   traversing firewalls is a problem, or where data encryption is
   required.

   In order to use this module you must have a server that can
   communicate via HTTP or HTTPS with this module that follows
   exactly the format decribed in the specifications section.

   The module can provide SSL, authentication, and all the
   functionalities of an opensips db as long as the server
   supports them ( except result_fetch).

   There is a slight difference between the url of db_http and the
   urls of the other db modules. The url doesn't have to contain
   the database name. Instead, everything that is after the
   address is considered to be a path to the db resource, it may
   be missing.

   Even if using HTTPS the url must begin with "http://" , and the
   SSL parameter for the module must be set to 1.

   Example 1.1. Setting db_url for a module
...
modparam("presence", "db_url","http://user:pass@localhost:13100")
or
modparam("presence", "db_url","http://user:pass@www.some.com/some/some")
...

1.4. Exported Functions

1.5. Server specifications

1.5.1. Queries

   The server must accept queries as HTTP queries.

   The queries are of 2 types : GET and POST.Both set variables
   that must be interpreted by the server. All values are
   URL-encoded.

   There are several types of queries and the server can tell them
   apart by the query_type variable. Each type of query uses
   specific variables simillar to those in the opensips db_api.

   Example 1.10. Example query.
...
GET /presentity/?c=username,domain,event,expires HTTP/1.1
...

1.5.2. Variables

   A description of all the variables. Each variable can have
   either a single value or a comma-separated list of values. Each
   variable has a special meaning and can be used only with
   certain queries.

   The table on which operations will take place will be encoded
   in the url as the end of the url ( www.some.com/users will
   point to the users table).
     * k=
       Describes the keys (columns) that will be used for
       comparison.Can have multiple values.
     * op=
       Describes the operators that will be used for
       comparison.Can have multiple values.
     * v=
       Describes the values that columns will be compaired
       against. Can have multiple values.
     * c=
       Describes the columns that will be selected from the
       result.Can have multiple values.
     * o=
       The column that the result will be ordered by. Has a single
       value.
     * uk=
       The keys(columns) that will be updated. Can have multiple
       values.
     * uv=
       The new values that will be put in the columns. Can have
       multiple values.
     * q=
       Describes a raw query. Will only be used if the server
       supports raw queries. Has a single value.
     * query_type=
       Describes the type of the current query. Can have a single
       value as described in the Query Types section.Has a single
       value. Will be present in all queries except the "SELECT"
       (normal query).

   Example 1.11. Example query with variables.
...
GET /presentity/?c=username,domain,event,expires HTTP/1.1
GET /version/?k=table_name&v=xcap&c=table_version HTTP/1.1
...
...
POST /active_watchers HTTP/1.1

k=id&v=100&query_type=insert
...


1.5.3. Query Types

   The types of the queries are described by the query_type
   variable. The value of the variable will be set to the exact
   name of the query.

   Queries for "SELECT" use GET and the rest use POST (insert,
   update, delete, replace, insert_update).
     * normal query
       Uses the k, op, v, c and o variables. This will not set the
       query_type variable and will use GET.
     * delete
       Uses the k, op and v variables.
     * insert
       Uses the k and v variables.
     * update
       Uses the k,op,v,uk and uv variables.
     * replace
       Uses the k and v variables. This is an optional type of
       query. If the module is not configured to use it it will
       not.
     * insert_update
       Uses the k and v variables. This is an optional type of
       query. If the module is not configured to use it it will
       not.
     * custom
       Uses the q variable. This is an optional type of query. If
       the module is not configured to use it it will not.

   Example 1.12. More query examples.

...
POST /active_watchers HTTP/1.1

k=id&op=%3D&v=100&query_type=delete
...

...
POST /active_watchers HTTP/1.1

k=id&op=%3D&v=100&uk=id&uv=101&query_type=update
...


1.5.4. NULL values in queries

   NULL values in queries are represented as a string of length 1
   containing a single character with value '\0'.

   Example 1.13. NULL query example.

...
POST /active_watchers HTTP/1.1

k=id&op=%3D&v=%00&query_type=delete
...



1.5.5. Server Replies

   If the query is ok (even if the answer is empty) the server
   must reply with a 200 OK HTTP reply with a body containing the
   types and values of the columns.

   The server must reply with a delimiter separated list of values
   and columns.

   Each element in the list must be seperated from the one before
   it by a field delimiter that must be the same as the one set as
   a parameter from the script for the module. The last element of
   each line must not be followed by a field delimiter, but by a
   row delimiter.

   The first line of the reply must contain a list of the types of
   values of each column. The types can be any from the list:
   integer, string, str, blob, date.

   Each following line contains the values of each row from the
   result.

   If the query produced an error the server must reply with a
   HTTP 500 reply, or with a corresponding error code (404, 401).

   Example 1.14. Example Reply.
...
int;string;blob
6;something=something;1000
100;mine;10002030
...

1.5.6. Reply Quoting

   Because the values may contain delimiters inside, the server
   must perform quoting when necessary (there is no problem if it
   does it even when it is not necessary).

   A quote delimiter must be defined and must be the same as the
   one set from the script ( by default it is "|" ).

   If a value contains a field , row or a quote delimiter it must
   be placed under quotes. A quote delimiter inside a value must
   be preceeded by another quote delimiter.

   Example 1.15. Quoting Example.
...
int;string;blob
6;|ana;maria|;1000
100;mine;10002030
3;mine;|some||more;|
...

1.5.7. Last inserted id

   This is an optional feature and may be enabled if one wants to
   use it.

   In order to use this feature the server must place the id of
   the last insert in the 200 reply for each insert query.

1.5.8. Authentication and SSL

   If the server supports authentication and SSL, the module can
   be enabled to use SSL. Authentication will always be used if
   needed.

   The module will try to use the most secure type of
   authentication that is provided by the server from: Basic,
   Digest,GSSNEGOTIATE and NTLM.
