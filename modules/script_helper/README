Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The purpose of the Script Helper module is to simplify the
   scripting process in OpenSIPS when doing basic scenarios. At
   the same time, it is useful to script writers as it contains
   basic SIP routing logic, and thus it allows them to focus more
   on the particular aspects of their OpenSIPS routing code.

1.2. How it works

   By simply loading the module, the following default logic will
   be embedded:
     * for initial SIP requests, the module will perform record
       routing before running the main request route
     * sequential SIP requests will be transparently handled - the
       module will perform loose routing, and the request route
       will not be run at all

   Currently, the module may be further configured to embed the
   following optional logic:
     * dialog support (dialog module dependency - must be loaded
       before this module)
     * an additional route to be run before relaying sequential
       requests

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * dialog (only if use_dialog is enabled).

1.3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. use_dialog (integer)

   Enables dialog support. Note that the dialog module must be
   loaded before this module when setting this parameter.

   Default value is 0 (disabled)

   Example 1.1. Setting use_dialog
...
modparam("script_helper", "use_dialog", 1)
...

1.4.2. create_dialog_flags (string)

   Flags used when creating dialogs. For details on these flags,
   please refer to the create_dialog() function of the dialog
   module.

   Default value is "" (no flags are set)

   Example 1.2. Setting create_dialog_flags
...
modparam("script_helper", "create_dialog_flags", "PpB")
...

1.4.3. sequential_route (string)

   Optional route to be run just before sequential requests are
   relayed. If the exit script statement is used inside this
   route, the module assumes that the relaying logic has been
   handled.

   By default, this parameter is not set

   Example 1.3. Setting sequential_route
...
modparam("script_helper", "sequential_route", "sequential_handling")
...
route [sequential_handling]
{
...
}
...

1.5. Known Issues

   The Max-Forwards header is currently not handled at all.

   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files
