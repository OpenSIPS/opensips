This is a module to help with SDP mangling.
Still in testing.

Exported Parameters: None
--------------------



Exported Functions:
------------------


Name:	sdp_mangle_ip
		--------------
Params:	pattern - a pair ip/mask used to match ip's located inside 
				  SDP package in lines c=IN IP4 ip
				  This lines will only be mangled if located ip 
				  is in the network described by this pattern
				  Examples of valid patterns are 
				  	"10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0" or "10.0.0.0/8" etc
		newip - a string representing the new ip to be put
				inside SDP package if old ip address matches pattern
Desc:	Changes ip addresses inside SDP package in lines describing
		connections like c=IN IP4
		Currently in only changes IP4 addresses since IP6 probably 
		will not need to traverse NAT :)
Example:	res = sdp_mangle_ip("10.0.0.0/8","193.175.135.38");
Returns: negative on error, or number of replacements - 1


Name:	sdp_mangle_port
		----------------
Params:	offset - an integer which will be added/substracted from 
				 the located port.
Desc:	Changes ports inside SDP package in lines describing
		media like m=audio 13451
Example: res = sdp_mangle_port(-12000)
Returns: negative on error, or number of replacements - 1



Name:	encode_contact
		---------------
Params:	encoding_prefix - something to allow us to determine that a contact is encoded
		publicip - a routable ip,most probably you should put your external ip of your NAT box
Desc:	This function will encode uri-s inside Contact header in the following manner
		sip:username:password@ip:port;transport=protocol goes  sip:enc_pref*username*ip*port*protocol@public_ip
		* is  the default separator
Example: if (src_ip == 10.0.0.0/8) encode_contact("enc_prefix","193.175.135.38"); 
Returns: negative on error, 0 on succes



Name:	decode_contact()
		-----------------
Params:	separator - a char representing the separator between fields username,password etc.Default encoding uses '*'	
Desc:	This function will decode uri-s inside Contact header in the following manner
		sip:enc_pref*username*ip*port*protocol@public_ip goes to sip:username:password@ip:port;transport=protocol
		
Example:	if (uri =~ "^enc*") {decode_contact('*');}
Returns: negative on error, 0 on succes
