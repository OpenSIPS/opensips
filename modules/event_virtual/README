   1.1. Virtual socket

Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   Virtual module provides the possibility to have multiple
   external applications, using different transport protocols,
   subscribed to the OpenSIPS Event Interface as a single virtual
   subscriber, for a specific event.When an event is triggered,
   the virtual module notifies the specified transport modules
   with three different policies:
     * parallel - all the subsribers are notified at once
     * failover - for every event raised, try to notify the
       subscribers, in the order in which they are given, until
       the first successful notification
     * round-robin for every event raised, notify the subscribers
       alternatively, in the order in which they are given (for
       each raised event notify a different subscriber)

   Only one expire value can be used, for the whole virtual
   subscribtion, not for every subscriber separately.

1.2. Virtual socket syntax

   virtual:policy subscriber_1 [[subscriber_2] ...]

   Meanings:
     * virtual: - informs the Event Interface that the events sent
       to this subscriber should be handled by the event_virtual
       module
     * policy - subscribers notification policy, can have one of
       the following values: 'PARALLEL', 'FAILOVER',
       'ROUND-ROBIN', with the behaviour as described above
     * subscriber_1 - use the socket syntax for this specific
       subscriber (eg. "rabbitmq:guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/pike")

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:

   The OpenSIPS modules which implement the transport protocols
   used by the subscribers.

1.4. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none

1.5. Exported Parameters

   No parameters exported to be used from configuration file.

1.6. Exported Functions

   No function exported to be used from configuration file.

1.7. Example

   Example 1.1. Virtual socket

   The sockets of the subscribers should be separated by any
   number of spaces or tabs:

        virtual:PARALLEL rabbitmq:guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/pike flatst
ore:/var/log/opensips_proxy.log
