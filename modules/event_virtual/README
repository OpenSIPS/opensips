   1.1. Virtual socket

Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The event_virtual module provides the possibility to have
   multiple external applications, using different transport
   protocols, subscribed to the OpenSIPS Event Interface as a
   single virtual subscriber, for a specific event. When an event
   is triggered, the event_virtual module notifies the specified
   transport modules using one of the following policies:
     * PARALLEL - all subscribers (applications) are notified at
       once
     * FAILOVER - for every event raised, try to notify the
       subscribers, in the order in which they are given, until
       the first successful notification
     * ROUND-ROBIN - for every event raised, notify the
       subscribers alternatively, in the order in which they are
       given (for each raised event notify a different subscriber)

   Only one expire value can be used (for the whole virtual
   subscription), and not one for each individual subscriber.

1.2. Virtual socket syntax

   virtual:policy subscriber_1 [[subscriber_2] ...]

   Meanings:
     * virtual: - informs the Event Interface that the events sent
       to this subscriber should be handled by the event_virtual
       module
     * policy - subscriber notification policy, can have one of
       the following values: 'PARALLEL', 'FAILOVER', 'ROUND-ROBIN'
       (with the behaviour described above)
          + !! Important: Policies must always be specified as
            uppercase strings!
     * subscriber_1 - use the socket syntax for this specific
       subscriber (eg. "rabbitmq:guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/pike")

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:

   The OpenSIPS event modules which implement the transport
   protocols used by the subscribers.

1.4. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * none

1.5. Exported Parameters

   No exported parameters to be used in the configuration file.

1.6. Exported Functions

   No exported functions to be used in the configuration file.

1.7. Example

   Example 1.1. Virtual socket

   The sockets of the subscribers may be separated by any number
   of spaces or tabs:

        virtual:PARALLEL rabbitmq:guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672/pike flatst
ore:/var/log/opensips_proxy.log

   (1) DevScore = author_commits + author_lines_added /
   (project_lines_added / project_commits) + author_lines_deleted
   / (project_lines_deleted / project_commits)

   (2) including any documentation-related commits, excluding
   merge commits. Regarding imported patches/code, we do our best
   to count the work on behalf of the proper owner, as per the
   "fix_authors" and "mod_renames" arrays in
   opensips/doc/build-contrib.sh. If you identify any
   patches/commits which do not get properly attributed to you,
   please submit a pull request which extends "fix_authors" and/or
   "mod_renames".

   (3) ignoring whitespace edits, renamed files and auto-generated
   files
