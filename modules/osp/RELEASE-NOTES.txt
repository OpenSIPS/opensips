  Implemented routing and authorization validation.  The module can:
   o Request authorization and routing information from an OSP server
   o Use provided routes to:
     o Redirect the originating UI to all routes OR
     o Try all routes simultaneously using parallel forking OR
     o Try routes in the order they were received using sequential forking
   o Add and retrieve P-OSP-Auth-Token header
   o Perform local validation of the P-OSP-Auth-Token

2005 September 12
   o Bug 4863 - the module will remove OSP Auth token from the incoming Invite
     after validating the token and before forwarding Invite to the next hop.
   o Bug 4891 - added a new flag 'validate_call_id' for disabling call id
     validation in OSP tokens.  The value is optional, call id validation
     can be turned off by setting the value to 0 (No).  It may be used for
     interoperability issues with some OSP clients sending invalid call ids
     in Authorization Requests.
   o Bug 4986 - changed return value for 'prepareallosproutes' from
     0 - stop routing logic to 1 - true
   o Bug 5039 - changed return value for 'preparenextosproute' when there is
     no more routes from 0 - stop routing logic to -1 - false
   o Bug 5039 - changed return value for 'preparenextosproute' when there is
   o Bug 4893 - sequential routing (in failure_route[1]) now checks for code
     487 (Canceled) before trying the next OSP route.
   o Bug 4892 - removed trailing binary chars from some log messages.
   o Bug 4987 - fixed a compile time error on Solaris
   o Bug 4946 - added README file

2005 September 26
   o Bug 5094 - don't route the call if OSP token validation fails.
   o Bug 5109 - send "100 Trying" message before requesting OSP routes.
   o Bug 5111 - fixed typos in error messages.
   o Bug 5153 - removed trailing binary chars from P-OSP-Auth-Token header
                value.

2005 October 3
   o Report OSP usage indications after the call set-up and tear down
     transactions complete.

2005 October 11
   o Report call set-up usage indication after receiving either 200 or 202.
   o Report termination cause code for duration usage indications as 10,016
     instead of 1,016.
   o Improved error checking and logging.
   o Bug 5366 - removed a memory leak in usage reporting logic.

2005 November 4
   o Bug 5110 and 5531 - Updated the sample configuration files to not
     fail-over on 486 - user busy and 408 - user not available.
   o Bug 5535 - The module will report call set-up usage details after
     sending any final response code to UAC.

2005 November 7
   o Copied files from cvs.berlios.de:/cvsroot/osp-module

2006 August 3
   o Using BRAND_ROUTE approach to add route specific header to avoid sending
     an OSP token to a non-OSP destination.
