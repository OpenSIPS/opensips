Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   This module is an extension to the AKA_AUTH module providing a
   Diameter AKA AV Manager that implements the
   Multimedia-Auth-Request and Multimedia-Auth-Answer Diameter
   commands defined in the Cx interface of the ETSI TS 129 229
   specifications in order to fetch a set of authentication
   vectors and feed them in the AKA authentication process.

   When the AKA_AUTH module needs a new authentication vector to
   do an aka_challenge(), it may require this module to fetch a
   set of authentication vectors for the purpose. The module packs
   the query in a MAR (Multimedia-Auth-Request) command and sends
   it to an HSS Diameter server. When an MAA
   (Multimedia-Auth-Answer) command is received in response, the
   corresponding authentication vectors are gathered and fed back
   to the AUTH_AKA engine.

   It uses the AAA_Diameter module to perform the Diameter
   requests. It may run in both a synchronous and asynchronous
   mode, depending on how the AUTH_AKA module performs the query.

1.2. Setup

   The module requires an aaa_diameter connection to an HSS
   Diameter server that implements the Cx interfaces and is able
   to provide authentication vectors through the
   Multimedia-Auth-Request and Multimedia-Auth-Answer commands.

   The format of the command, along with the required fields can
   be found in the example/aka_av_diameter.dictionary file located
   in the module's source directory, as well as in the Diameter
   Commands Example section.

   Note: the module internals uses the AVPs names found in the
   provided dictionary - changing the file may break the behavior
   of the module.

1.3. Dependencies

1.3.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The module depends on the following modules (in the other words
   the listed modules must be loaded before this module):
     * auth_aka -- AKA Authentication module that triggers the AKA
       authentication process
     * aaa_diameter -- AAA Diameter module that implements the
       Diameter communication to the HSS Server.

1.3.2. External Libraries or Applications

   This module does not depend on any external library.

1.4. Exported Parameters

1.4.1. aaa_url (string)

   This is the url representing the connection to the AAA server.

   Note: Currently the module only supports connections to a
   Diameter server. The path to the AVPs configuration file is
   also required, otherwise the module will not start, or not work
   properly.

   Example 1.1. aaa_url parameter usage
modparam("auth_aaa", "aaa_url", "diameter:freeDiameter.conf;extra-avps-f
ile:/etc/freeDiameter/aka_av_diameter.dictionary")

1.4.2. realm (string)

   The Realm used in the Origin Diameter commands.

   Default value is “diameter.test”.

   Example 1.2. realm parameter usage

modparam("aka_av_diameter", "realm", "scscf.ims.mnc001.mcc001.3gppnetwor
k.org")

1.5. Diameter Commands File

   File that should be provided to the aaa_diameter connection.
