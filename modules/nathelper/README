This is a module to help with NAT traversal. In particular , it helps
symmetric UAs that don't advertise they are symmetric and are not able
to determine their public address. fix_nated_contact rewrites Contact
header field with request's source address:port pair. 
add_direction_active adds the active direction indication to SDP (flag
0x01) and updates source IP address too (flag 0x02).

Known devices that get along over NATs with nathelper are ATAs
(as clients) and Cisco Gateways (since 12.2(T)) as servers.
