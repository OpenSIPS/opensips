	The Event (based) Routing module, or shortly the EBR module, provides a 
	mechanism that allows different SIP processings (of messages in script) to
	communicate and synchronize between through OpenSIPS Events 
	(see https://opensips.org/Documentation/Interface-Events-2-3).
	</para>
	<para>
	This mechanism is based on the Subscribe-Notify concept. Any SIP processing
	may subscribe to various OpenSIPS Events  Upon Event raising, the 
	subscriber will be notified, so it will be able to make use of the data
	attached to the Event. Note that the Event raising may take place in a
	completely different SIP processing context, completely unrelated to the
	subscriber processing.
	</para>
	<para>
	Also, the Events are generated either internally by OpenSIPS (predefined 
	Events), either from the script level (custom Events). Please refer to the
	Event Interface documentation for more on how the Events are generated 
	(https://opensips.org/Documentation/Interface-Events-2-3).
	</para>
	<para>
	Depending on how the notification is handled by the subscribing processing,
	we distinguish two main scenarios:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		<para>
		The subscriber waits in async. mode for the receiving the notification;
		the processing of the subscriber will suspend and it will be fully
		resumed when the notification is received (or a timeout occurs).
		</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		<para>
		The subscriber continues its processing after subscription, without any
		waiting. Whenever a notification is received, a script route (armed by
		the subscription) will be executed. Note that this notification route
		is executed outside any context of the original processing (nothing
		is inherited in this route). The Event triggering the notification is
		exposed in the notification route, via AVP variables.
		</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
	So, EBR allows your SIP processing to synchronize or the exchange info
	between, even if these processings are completely unrelated from SIP, time
	or handling perspective.
	</para>
	<para>
	With the help of the EBR support, more advanced routing scenarios are 
	possible now, scenarios where you need to handle and put together different
	processing as type and time, like the handling of various calls with the 
	handling of registrations or with the DTMF extraction. For more, see
	the <xref linkend="Examples"/> section.

	<section id="func_notify_on_event" xreflabel="notify_on_event()">
		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">notify_on_event(event, filter, route, timeout)</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		This function creates a subscription to a given Event. A filter can be
		used (over the attributes of the Event) in order to filter even more
		the needed notifications (only Events matching the filter will be
		notified to this subscriber).
		</para>
		<para>
		Upon Event notification, the given script route (usually called 
		notification route) will be executed. No variables, SIP message, SIP 
		transaction/dialog or any other context related to subscriber will be 
		inherited from subscriber processing into this notification route.
		</para>
		<para>
		The Event attributes will be exposed in the notification route via AVP
		variables as <emphasis>$avp(attr_name) = attr_value</emphasis>.
		</para>
		<para>
		As an exception, in the notification route, the EBR module will make 
		available the transaction ID from the subscriber context. Note that 
		it's not the transaction itself, but its ID. There are some TM 
		functions (like <emphasis>t_inject_branches</emphasis>) which can 
		operate on transactions based on their ID. Of course, you need to 
		have a transaction create in the subscriber processing before calling
		the  <emphasis>notify_on_event()</emphasis> function.
		</para>
		<para>
		This function can be used from REQUEST_ROUTE.
		</para>
		<para>Parameters: </para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>event</emphasis> (string) -the name of the Event to subscribe for
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>filter</emphasis> (var) - a AVP variable holding (as multi
			value array) all the filters to be applied on the event (before
			notification). The filter value has the format "key=value"
			where the "key" must match an attribute name of the Event. The
			"value" is the desired value for the attribute;  it may be a shell
			wildcard pattern. Ex: "aor=bob@*"
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>route</emphasis> (string) -the name of the script route to be
			executed upon Event notification
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
			<emphasis>timeout</emphasis> (int) - for how long the subscription is
			active before expiring (integer in seconds). Note: during its 
			lifetime, a subscription may be notified several or zero times.
			</para></listitem>

		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">wait_for_event(event,filter,timeout)</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		Similar to the <emphasis>notify_on_event</emphasis>, this function
		creates an Event subscriber for the given event and filter. But this
		function will do async waiting (with suspend and resume) for receiving
		the notification on the desired Event.

	<title>Usage Examples</title>

	<section>
		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">Push Notification</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		We use <emphasis>notify_on_event</emphasis> to capture the events on
		new contact registrations for callee. Once the call is sent to callee,
		based on the notification (for new contacts) we inject the newly
		registered contacts as new branches in the ongoing transaction.
		</para>
		<para>
		Schematics : when we send a call to a user, we subscribe to see any
		new contacts being registered by the user. On such a notification,
		we add the new contact as a new branch to the ongoing transaction
		(ringing) to user.
		</para>
		<example>
		<title>Push Notification script</title>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
...
route[route_to_user] {

    # prepare transaction for branch injection; it is mandatory
    # to create the transaction before the subscription, otherwise
    # the EBR module will not pass the transaction ID into the
    # notification route
    t_newtran();

    # keep the transaction alive (even if all branches will 
    # terminate) until the FR INVITE timer hits (we want to wait
    # for new possible contacts being registered)
    t_wait_for_new_branches();

    # subscribe to new contact registration event,
    # but for our callee only
    $avp(filter) = "aor="+$rU;
    notify_on_event("E_UL_CONTACT_INSERT",$avp(filter),
        "fork_call", 20);

    # fetch already registered contacts and relay if any
    if (lookup("location"))
        route(relay);
    # if there were no contacts available (so no branches 
    # created so far), the created transaction will still be 
    # waiting for new branches due to the usage of the 
    # t_wait_for_new_branches() function

    exit;

		<title>
		<function moreinfo="none">Call pickup</function>
		</title>
		<para>
		The scenario is Alice calling to bob, Bob does not pickup and Charlie
		is performing call pickup (to get the call from Alice)
		</para>
		<para>
		We use <emphasis>notify_on_event</emphasis> to link the two calls: the
		one from Alice to Bob  and the one from Charlie to call pickup service.
		</para>
		<para>
		Schematics: when we send a call to a user within a pickup group, we
		subscribe to see if there is any call to the pickup service (from 
		another member of the same pickup group). When we have a call to 
		the pickup service, we raise from script an event - this event will
		be notified to the first call and we cancel the branches to Bob and
		inject the registered contacts for the user calling to pickup group
		(Charlie).
		</para>
