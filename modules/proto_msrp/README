Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The proto_msrp module provides the MSRP protocol stack, meaning
   the network read/wite (plain and TLS), message parsing and
   assembling, transactional layer and the basic signalling
   operations.

   Once loaded, you will be able to define MSRP listeners in your
   script, by adding its IP, and optionally the listening port, in
   your configuration file, similar to this example:

...
socket=msrp:127.0.0.1:65432
socket=msrps:127.0.0.1:65431
...

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * tls_mgm - you need to load this module if using MSRPS
       (secure) sockets. Via this module you will manage the SSL
       certificates

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. send_timeout (integer)

   Time in milliseconds after a MSRP connection will be closed if
   it is not available for blocking writing in this interval (and
   OpenSIPS wants to send something on it).

   Default value is 100 ms.

   Example 1.1. Set send_timeout parameter
...
modparam("proto_msrp", "send_timeout", 200)
...

1.3.2. max_msg_chunks (integer)

   The maximum number of chunks that a SIP message is expected to
   arrive via MSRP. If a packet is received more fragmented than
   this, the connection is dropped (either the connection is very
   overloaded and this leads to high fragmentation - or we are the
   victim of an ongoing attack where the attacker is sending the
   traffic very fragmented in order to decrease our performance).

   Default value is 4.

   Example 1.2. Set max_msg_chunks parameter
...
modparam("proto_msrp", "max_msg_chunks", 8)
...

1.3.3. tls_handshake_timeout (integer)

   Sets the timeout (in milliseconds) for the SSL handshake
   sequence to complete. It may be necessary to increase this
   value when using a CPU intensive cipher for the connection to
   allow time for keys to be generated and processed.

   The timeout is invoked during acceptance of a new connection
   (inbound) and during the wait period when a new session is
   being initiated (outbound).

   Default value is 100.

   Example 1.3. Set tls_handshake_timeout variable

param("proto_msrp", "tls_handshake_timeout", 200) # number of millisecon
ds


1.3.4. cert_check_on_conn_reusage (integer)

   This parameter turns on or off the extra checking/matching of
   the TLS domain (SSL certificate) when comes to reusing an
   existing TLS connection. Without this extra check, only IP and
   port of the connections will be check (in order to re-use an
   existing connection). With this extra check, the connection to
   be reused must have the same SSL certificate as the one set for
   the current signaling operation.

   This checking is done only when comes to send SIP traffic via
   TLS and it is applied only against connections that were
   created / initiated by OpenSIPS (as TLS client). Any accepte
   connection (as TLS server) will automatically match (the extra
   test will be skipped).

   Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Example 1.4. Set cert_check_on_conn_reusage parameter
...
modparam("proto_msrp", "cert_check_on_conn_reusage", 1)
...

1.3.5. trace_destination (string)

   Trace destination as defined in the tracing module. Currently
   the only tracing module is proto_hep. Network events such as
   connect, accept and connection closed events shall be traced
   along with errors that could appear in the process.

   WARNING: A tracing module must be loaded in order for this
   parameter to work. (for example proto_hep).

   Default value is none(not defined).

   Example 1.5. Set trace_destination parameter
...
modparam("proto_hep", "hep_id", "[hep_dest]10.0.0.2;transport=tcp;versio
n=3")

modparam("proto_msrp", "trace_destination", "hep_dest")
...

1.3.6. trace_on (int)

   This controls whether tracing for MSRP is on or not. You still
   need to define Section 1.3.5, “trace_destination (string)”in
   order to work, but this value will be controlled using MI
   function Section 1.4.1, “ msrp_trace ”.
   Default value is 0(tracing inactive).

   Example 1.6. Set trace_on parameter
...
modparam("proto_msrp", "trace_on", 1)
...

1.3.7. trace_filter_route (string)

   Define the name of a route in which you can filter which
   connections will be trace and which connections won't be. In
   this route you will have information regarding source and
   destination ips and ports for the current connection. To
   disable tracing for a specific connection the last call in this
   route must be drop, any other exit mode resulting in tracing
   the current connection ( of course you still have to define a
   Section 1.3.5, “trace_destination (string)” and trace must be
   on at the time this connection is opened.

   IMPORTANT Filtering on ip addresses and ports can be made using
   $si and $sp for matching either the entity that is connecting
   to OpenSIPS or the entity to which OpenSIPS is connecting. The
   name might be misleading ( $si meaning the source ip if you
   read the docs) but in reality it is simply the socket other
   than the OpenSIPS socket. In order to match OpenSIPS interface
   (either the one that accepted the connection or the one that
   initiated a connection) $socket_in(ip) (ip) and
   $socket_in(port) (port) can be used.

   WARNING: IF Section 1.3.6, “trace_on (int)” is set to 0 or
   tracing is deactived via the mi command Section 1.4.1, “
   msrp_trace ” this route won't be called.
   Default value is none(no route is set).

   Example 1.7. Set trace_filter_route parameter
...
modparam("proto_msrp", "trace_filter_route", "msrp_filter")
...
/* all MSRP connections will go through this route if tracing is activat
ed
 * and a trace destination is defined */
route[msrp_filter] {
        ...
        /* all connections opened from/by ip 1.1.1.1:8000 will be traced
           on interface 1.1.1.10:5060(opensips listener)
           all the other connections won't be */
         if ( $si == "1.1.1.1" && $sp == 8000 &&
                $socket_in(ip) == "1.1.1.10"  && $socket_in(port) == 506
0)
                exit;
        else
                drop;
}
...
