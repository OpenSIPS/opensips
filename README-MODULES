'Use' tells how deployable a module is. Regular indicates
we deploy and use this feature in our infrastructure.
Experimental tells we are still gaining operation experience.

'Maturity' is label as stable if a module has been deployed
for longer time, alpha if it is still being developed and
beta if it is under test.

'Depends on' field tells which modules the module needs.
