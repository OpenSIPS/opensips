Use tells how deployable a module is. Regular indicates
we deploy and use this feature in our infrastructure.
Experimental tells we are still gaining operation experience.
Temporary labels modules which momentarily fix some
bugs/lacks and will disappear later. Example modules
are primarily useful as educational source code for
ser programmers.

Maturity is label as stable if a module has been deployed
for longer time, alpha if it is still being developed and
beta if it is under test.

Modules underway include presence server functionality,
firewall control, message store and more. If you are
interested in any of these or other modules, write us
to info@iptel.org.
