Chapter 1. Admin Guide

1.1. Overview

   The proto_udp module is a built-in transport module which
   exports the required logic in order to handle UDP-based
   communication. (socket initialization and send/recv primitives
   to be used by higher-level network layers)

   Once loaded, you will be able to define "udp:" listeners in
   your script.

1.2. Dependencies

1.2.1. OpenSIPS Modules

   The following modules must be loaded before this module:
     * None.

1.2.2. External Libraries or Applications

   The following libraries or applications must be installed
   before running OpenSIPS with this module loaded:
     * None.

1.3. Exported Parameters

1.3.1. udp_port (integer)

   The default port to be used for all UDP related operation. Be
   careful as the default port impacts both the SIP listening part
   (if no port is defined in the UDP listeners) and the SIP
   sending part (if the destination URI has no explicit port).

   If you want to change only the listening port for UDP, use the
   port option in the SIP listener defintion.

   Default value is 5060.

   Example 1.1. Set udp_port parameter
...
modparam("proto_udp", "udp_port", 5070)
...

Chapter 2. Frequently Asked Questions

   2.1.

   After switching to OpenSIPS 2.1, I'm getting this error:
   "listeners found for protocol udp, but no module can handle it"

   You need to load the "proto_udp" module. In your script, make
   sure you do a loadmodule "proto_udp.so" after setting the
   mpath.

   2.2.

   I cannot locate "proto_udp.so". Where is it?

   The "proto_udp" and "proto_tcp" modules are simply built into
   the opensips binary by default. They are not available as
   shared libraries, but look like modules for code consistency
   reasons.
