/*!
  * \page DataTypeText Common data type for text variables.
  *
  * This data type encapsulates a standard C char array. It's recommended to
  * use this type if you need variables holding text. It caches the length of
  * the C string to avoid repetive calls to strlen, thus improving performance.
  *
  * It's also safer to explicitly give the length to string operations of the
  * core or C libraries to prevent problems because of buffer overflows and
  * missing null-termination.
  *
  * Important: The char array inside this type is not null-terminated. So if
  * you need to work with external functions that rely on this termination you
  * must add a zero at the end by yourself. Keep in mind that the length of the
  * char array is normally not large enough to store this additional
  * null-termination.
  *
  * So you must copy the char array to a new buffer that is (len + 1) big,
  * otherwise memory corruption and undefined behavour will occur.
  * Most libraries often provide functions that can work with an explicit given
  * length, thus avoiding the need for this copy operation.
