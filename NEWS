***********************************************

0.8.12 changes

new modules:
 - answer server options requests [options]
texops:
 - subst('s/re/repl/flags') support
core:
 - added switch to check the config file (-c)
 - changes: removed len_gt() and replaced with if (msg:len op number|max_len)
 - multiple operator support: ==, != for special operations (e.g myself, ip)
                              ==, !=, ~= for strings
                              ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= for integers
 - new config variables:
     advertised_address= ip | string
       address advertised in via and in the DST_* lumps (e.g RR)
       This is the default value, if empty (default) the socket
       address will be used.
       WARNING: - don't set it unless you know what you are doing
                 (e.g. nat traversal)
               - you can set anything here, no check is made
                (e.g. foo.bar will be accepted even if 
                 foo.bar doesn't exist)
    advertised_port= no
       port advertised in via and in the DST_*lumps (e.g. RR)
       This is the default value, if empty (default) the socket
       port will be used.
       Same warnings as above.
 - new script commands:
    set_advertised_address(ip|string)
       same as advertised_address but it affects only the current message:
       Message host/lump address= the set_advertised one if
       present, else advertised_address else socket address.
    set_advertised_port(no)
       same as advertised_port but it affects only the current
       message; see set_advertised_address & s/address/port/g

Changes to use of ser scripts
=============================

About Multiple Transport Support
--------------------------------
SER now suports multiple transport protocols: UDP and TCP. As there
may be UAs which support only either protocol and cannot speak to
each other directly, we recommend to alway record-route SIP requests,
to keep the transport-translating SER in path. Also, if a destination
transport is not known, stateful forwarding is recommended -- use of
stateless forwarding for TCP2UDP would result in loss of reliability.


core
----
- reply_route has been renamed to failure_route -- the old name caused
  too much confusion
- forward_tcp and forward_udp can force SER to forward via specific
  transport protocol

acc module:
-----------
- radius and sql support integrated in this module; you need to
  recompile to enable it
- acc_flag is now called log_flag to better reflect it relates
  to the syslog mode (as opposed to sql/radius); for the same
  reasons, the accounting action is now called "acc_log_request"
  and the option for missed calls "log_missed_calls"
- log_fmt allows now to specify what will be printed to syslog

auth module:
------------
- auth module has been split in auth, auth_db, auth_radius, group
  group_radius, uri and uri_radius 
- all the parameters that were part of former auth module are now 
  part of auth_db module
- auth_db module contains all functions needed for database
  authentication
- auth_radius contains functions needed for radius authentication
- group module contains group membership checking functions
- group_radius contains radius group membeship checking functions
- is_in_group has been renamed to is_user_in and places to groups
  module
- check_to and check_from have been moved to the uri module
 

im module:
----------
- im is no longer used and has been obsoleted by TM

exec module:
------------
- exec_uri and exec_user have been obsoleted by exec_dset; 
  exec_dset is identical to exec_uri in capabilities; it 
  additionaly passes content of request elements (header 
  fields and URI parts) in environment variables; users of 
  exec_user can use exec_dset now and use the "URI_USER"  
  variable to learn user part of URI
- exec_dset and exec_msg return false, if return value of 
  script does not euqal zero
- exec_dset takes an additional parameter, which enables 
  validation of SIP URIs returned by external application

jabber module:
--------------
- presence support for Jabber users is enabled loading the PA
  module and using handle_subscribe("jabber") for SUBSCRIBE 
  requests to jabber user 

msilo module:
-------------
- m_store has now a parameter to set what should be considered
  for storing as destination uri. This enables support for saving
  the messages on negative replies.

radius_acc module:
------------------
- radius_acc module has been removed and radius accounting 
  is now part of acc module

registrar/usrloc modules:
-------------------------
- multi domain support, the modules user username@domain as AOR
  if enabled
- descent modification time ordering of contacts
- case sensitive/insensitive comparison of URI can be enabled

rr module:
----------
- addRecordRoute has been replaced with record_route
- rewriteFromRoute has been replaced with loose_route()
- a new option, "enable_full_lr" can be set to make life
  with misimplemented UAs easier and put LR in from "lr=on"
- rr module can insert two Record-Route header fields when
  necesarry (disconnected networks, UDP->TCP and so on)

tm module:
----------
- t_reply_unsafe, used in former versions within reply_routes,
  is deprecated; now t_reply is used from any places in script
- t_on_negative is renamed to t_on_failure -- the old name just
  caused too much confusion
- FIFO t_uac used by some applications (like serweb) has been
  replaced with t_uac_dlg (which allows easier use by dialog-
  oriented applications, like click-to-dial) 
- if you wish to do forward to another destination from 
  failure_route (reply_route formerly), you need to call t_relay
  or t_relay_to explicitely now
- t_relay_to has been replaced with t_relay_to_udp and t_relay_to_tcp
