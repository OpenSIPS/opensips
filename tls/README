Chapter 1. User's Guide

1.1. Overview

   TLS is an optional part of the OpenSIPS's core, not a module.
   TLS, as defined in SIP RFC 3261, is a mandatory feature for
   proxies and can be used to secure the SIP signalling on a
   hop-by-hop basis (not end-to-end). TLS works on top of TCP.
   DTLS, or TLS over UDP is already defined by IETF and may
   become available in the future.
     _________________________________________________________

1.2. History

   The TLS support was originally developed by Peter Griffiths
   and posted as a patch on SER development mailing list. Thanks
   to Cesc Santasusana, several problems were fixed and some
   improvements were added.

   The TLS support was simultaneously added in both projects. In
   SER, the support was committed in a separate "experimental"
   CVS tree, as patch to the main CVS tree. In OpenSIPS, the
   support was integrated directly into the CVS tree, as a
   built-in component, and is part of stable OpenSIPS since
   release >=1.0.0.
     _________________________________________________________

1.3. Scenario

   By the increased number of providers the SIP world is
   continuously growing. More users means more calls and more
   calls means a high probability for a user to receive calls
   from totally unknown people or, in the worst case, to receive
   unwanted calls. To prevent this, a defense mechanism must be
   adopted by the SIP provider. Since only the called user is
   fully able to classify a call as being unwanted, the SIP
   server, based on all information regarding the call should
   notify the user about the desirability of the call.
   Information like the caller domain, the received source or the
   incoming protocol can be very useful for a SIP server to
   establish the nature of the call.

   As this information is quite limited, is very improbable for a
   server to be able detect the unwanted calls - there are many
   calls that it cannot predict anything about its status
   (neutral calls). So, instead on alerting the called user about
   unwanted calls, the server can notify the user about calls
   that are considered trusted - calls for which the server is
   100% sure there are not unwanted.

   So, a trust concept must be defined for SIP servers. Which
   calls are trusted and which are not? A call is trusted if the
   caller can be identify as a trustable user - a user about we
   have reliable information.

   Since all the user from its domain are authenticated (or
   should be), a SIP server can consider all the calls generated
   by its user as trusted. Now we have to extend the trust
   concept to the multi-domain level. A mutual agreement, between
   several domains, can establish a trusting relationship. So, a
   domain (called A) will consider also as trusted calls all the
   calls generated by user from a different domain (called B) and
   vice-versa. But just an agreement is not enough; since the
   authentication information is strictly limited to a domain (a
   domain can authenticate only its own user, not the user from
   other domains), there is still the problem of checking the
   authenticity of the caller - he can impersonate (by a false
   FROM header) a user from a domain that is trusted.

   The answer to this problem is TLS (Transport Layer Security).
   All calls via domain A and domain B will be done via TLS.
   Authentication in origin domain plus TLS transport between
   domains will make the call 100% trusted for the target domain.

   For such a mechanism to work, the following requirements must
   be met:

     * all UA must have set as outbound proxy their home server.
     * all SIP servers must authenticated all the calls generated
       by their own users.
     * all SIP servers must relay the calls generated be their
       user to a trusted domain via TLS.

   Based on this, a server can classify as trusted a call for one
   of its user only if the call is also generated by one of its
   users or is the call is received from a trusted domain ( which
   is equivalent with a call received via TLS). Untrusted call
   will be calls received from users belonging to untrusted
   domains or from users from trusted domains, but whose calls
   are not routed via their home server (so, they are not
   authenticated by there home servers).

   Once the server is able to tell if the call is trusted or not,
   the still open issue is about the mechanism used by server to
   notify the called user about the nature of the incoming call.

   One way to do it is by remotely changing the ringing type of
   the called user's phone. This can be done by inserting special
   header into the INVITE request. Such feature is supported by
   now by several hardphones like CISCO ATA, CISCO 7960 and SNOM.
   This phones can change their ringing tone based on the present
   or content of the "Alert-Info" SIP header as follows:

     * CISCO ATA - it has 4 pre-defined ringing types. The
       Alert-Info header must look like "Alert-info: Bellcore-drX
       EOH"" where X can be between 1 and 4. Note that 1 is the
       phone default ringing tone.
     * CISCO 7960 - it has 2 pre-defined ringing types and the
       possibility of uploading new ones. The "Alert-Info" header
       must look like "Alert-info: X EOH" where X can be whatever
       number. When this header is present, the phones will not
       change the ringing tone, but the ringing pattern.
       Normally, the phone rings like
       [ring.........ring..........ring] where [ring] is the
       ringing tone; if the header is present, the ringing
       pattern will be [ring.ring.........ring.ring........]. So,
       to be able to hear some difference between the two
       patterns (and not only as length), its strongly
       recommended to have a highly asymmetric ringing type (as
       the pre-defined are not!!).
     * SNOM - The "Alert-Info" header must look like "Alert-info:
       URL EOH"" where URL can be a HTTP URL (for example) from
       where the phone can retrieve a ringing tone.

   A script example which implements this scenario can be found
   in Section 1.7.

1.4. Compiling TLS support

   To compile OpenSIPS with the TLS support, the environment
   variable TLS must be set. Note that this is required for all
   make commands (and not only for compiling). To set the
   variable, there are several ways to do it:

     * run all make commands like "TLS=1 make
       all|clean|install|etc"
     * before starting, export the TLS variable like "export
       TLS=1" (in bash) and use the make commands as usual. NOTE:
       the exported variable will be available only in current
       shell!
     * comment (to disable) or uncomment (to enable) the "TLS=1"
       line in the Makefile file; use the make commands as usual
       without any limitations.
     _________________________________________________________

1.4.1. Dependencies of external libraries

   OpenSIPS TLS support requires the following packages:

     * openssl or libssl >= 0.9.6
     * openssl-dev or libssl-dev
     _________________________________________________________

1.5. TLS setup

   TLS provides for strong authentication mechanism, as well as
   encryption following authentication. Of course, null
   encryption can be used, as well as weak authentication
   mechanisms (for example, anonymous, that is, no
   authentication).

   How does verification work? Verification is the process by
   which the authentication data provided by the peers is
   checked. This data consists usually of a peer certificate,
   plus a chain of trusted certification authorities. If for
   whatever reason, either of the peers thinks that the handshake
   is not valid, the ssl connection is not established. The
   reasons could be many: untrusted server certificate, too-weak
   algorithm, invalid client cert, no client authentication, ...

   This paragraph describe how to generate all the needed keys
   and certificates for establishing TLS connection with SER. The
   described TLS setup is based on the assumption that we run our
   own certificate authority (CA) and we want to connect via TLS
   several OpenSIPS servers (SIP domain).

   Warning

   In this setup the private key is not encrypted. The client and
   server keys must not be encrypted (or else OpenSIPS will ask
   you for a password on startup or will fail to load the
   certificates), but you should use a password at least for your
   CA private key.
     _________________________________________________________

1.5.1. Creating CA root certificate

   This part must be done only once, disregarding the number of
   how many interconnected OpenSIPS's we want to have.

   Using "opensipsctl tls rootCA", you may create a local root CA.

   The script will produce the private key (which will be used to
   sign client/server certificates) and the self-signed
   certificate authority.
     _________________________________________________________

1.5.2. Creating a server/client certificate

   This part must be done for each OpenSIPS server interconnected
   into your TLS enabled network: build a certificate request and
   sign it with a root CA (yourself or from third party).

   For this purpose you may use the "opensipsctl tls userCERT"

   The output of the script will be a directory containing all
   needed TLS files for configuring the OpenSIPS proxy (private
   key, signed certificate and CA list)
     _________________________________________________________

1.5.3. Setting OpenSIPS to use the certificate

   Append to the CA list file all the CA root certificates ( this
   list must contain all CA root certificates to be accepted by
   your server):

   If you use the "opensipsctl tls userCERT", it will create an
   one element CA list with the CA used to sign the certificate.

   To add more CAs to your list, just do:

     * cat add_cacert.pem >> calist.pem

   Now copy intended OpenSIPS certificate, private key and ca list
   file (basically the whole content of the opensipsX directory)
   to your intended machine in some directory (which will be
   further refer by path "path").

   There are some OpenSIPS TLS specific parameter that must be set
   up in OpenSIPS configuration file to use the certificate:

     * set up ser.cfg to use the certificate :
       tls_certificate=/path/cert.pem
     * set up ser to use the private key :
       tls_private_key=/path/privkey.pem
     * set up ser to use the CA list (optional - make sens only
       if tls_verify is turned on)
       tls_ca_list=/path/calist.pem
     _________________________________________________________

1.5.4. TLS OpenSIPS authentication behavior

   The "tls_verify_server", "tls_verify_client" and
   "tls_require_client_certificate" are OpenSIPS-names for the
   OpenSSL defined flags:

     * SSL_VERIFY_PEER is tls_verify_client/tls_verify_server
     * SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT is
       tls_require_client_certificate
       (tls_require_client_certificate is only used if
       tls_verify_client=1)

   If your OpenSIPS is acting as a server (incoming TLS
   connections), it will always send its server-side certificate
   to the client. If tls_verify_client is disabled (set to 0),
   your OpenSIPS will not request the client a client-certificate.
   This means that the client is not authenticated. If
   tls_verify_client=1, your OpenSIPS (the server) sends a
   client-certificate request to the client. But the client is
   free to not provide any. In this case,
   tls_require_client_certificate comes into play:

     * tls_require_client_certificate=0 - the verification
       process will succeed if the client does not provide a
       certificate, or if it provides one, it verifies correctly
       against the server's list of trusted certification
       authorities.
     * tls_require_client_certificate=1 - the verification
       process will only succeed if the client provides a
       certificate and this verifies correctly against the
       server's list of trusted CAs.

   If your OpenSIPS is acting as a client (outgoing TLS
   connections), it will always receive a certificate from the
   peer. If tls_verify_server is disabled (set to 0), your
   OpenSIPS will not verifiy the certificate and allows TLS
   connections to servers which do not present a valid
   certificate. If tls_verify_server=1, your OpenSIPS (the client)
   verifies the server certificate and will close the TLS
   connection if the server certificate is not valid.

   For more details see page man verify(1).

1.6. OpenSIPS TLS configuration parameters

   All these parameters can be used from the opensips.cfg file, to
   configure the behavior of OpenSIPS-TLS.
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.1. disable_tls=integer

   Disables TLS (no server is created on the listen addresses, no
   outgoing connections can be set up). A non 0 value means
   disable.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is 1 (TLS disabled). 

   Example 1-1. Set disable_tls variable
...
disable_tls = 1
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.2. listen=interface

   Not specific to TLS. Allows to specify the protocol (udp, tcp,
   tls), the IP address and the port where the listening server
   will be.

   Example 1-2. Set listen variable
...
listen = tls:1.2.3.4:5061
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.3. tls_port_no=number

   Sets the default TLS listening port.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is 5061. 

   Example 1-3. Set tls_port_no variable
...
tls_port_no = 5062
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.4. tls_method=value

   Sets the TLS protocol method which can be:

     * TLSv1 - means OpenSIPS will accept only TLSv1 connections
       (rfc3261 conformant).
     * SSLv3 - means OpenSIPS will accept only SSLv3 connections
     * SSLv2 - means OpenSIPS will accept only SSLv2 connections
       (almost all old clients support this).
     * SSLv23 - means OpenSIPS will accept any of the above
       methods, but the initial SSL hello must be v2 (in the
       initial hello all the supported protocols are advertised
       enabling switching to a higher and more secure version).
       The initial v2 hello means it will not accept connections
       from SSLv3 or TLSv1 only clients.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is SSLv23. 

   Warning

   Best is to use SSLv23, for extended compatibility. Using any
   of the other will restrict the version to just that one
   version. In fact, SSLv2 is disabled in the source code; to use
   it, you need to edit tls/tls_init.c

   If you want RFC3261 conformance and all your clients support
   TLSv1 (or you are planning to use encrypted "tunnels" only
   between different OpenSIPS proxies) use TLSv1. If you want to
   support older clients use SSLv23 (in fact most of the
   applications with SSL support use the SSLv23 method).

   Example 1-4. Set tls_method variable
...
tls_method = TLSv1
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.5. tls_certificate=file

   Public certificate file for OpenSIPS. It will be used as
   server-side certificate for incoming TLS connections, and as a
   client-side certificate for outgoing TLS connections.

   See previous chapter Section 1.5.3 for more information.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is "CFG_DIR/cert.pem". 

   Example 1-5. Set tls_certificate variable 
...
tls_certificate="/mycerts/certs/opensips_server_cert.pem"
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.6. tls_private_key=file

   Private key of the above certificate. I must be kept in a safe
   place with tight permissions!

   See previous chapter Section 1.5.3 for more information.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is "CFG_DIR/cert.pem". 

   Example 1-6. Set tls_private_key variable 
...
tls_private_key="/mycerts/private/prik.pem"
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.7. tls_ca_list=file

   List of trusted CAs. The file contains the certificates
   accepted, one after the other. It MUST be a file, not a
   folder.

   See previous chapter Section 1.5.3 for more information.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is "". 

   Example 1-7. Set tls_ca_list variable
...
tls_ca_list="/mycerts/certs/ca_list.pem"
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.8. tls_ciphers_list=string

   You can specify the list of algorithms for authentication and
   encryption that you allow. To obtain a list of ciphers and
   then choose, use the openssl application:

     * openssl ciphers 'ALL:eNULL:!LOW:!EXPORT'

   Warning

   Do not use the NULL algorithms (no encryption) ... only for
   testing!!!

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   It defaults to the OpenSSL default ciphers. 

   Example 1-8. Set tls_ciphers_list variable 
...
tls_ciphers_list="NULL"
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.9. tls_verify_client=number and
tls_require_client_certificate=number

   Technically, tls_verify_client activates SSL_VERIFY_PEER in
   the ssl_context. tls_require_client_certificate does the same
   with SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT, which is only possible
   if SSL_VERIFY_PEER is also turned on.

   These two parameters are used for incoming TLS connections,
   where OpenSIPS acts as server.

   See previous chapter Section 1.5.4 for more information.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value for both is 1. 

   Example 1-9. Set tls_verify_client &
   tls_require_client_certificate variable
...
# turn on the strictest and strongest authentication possible
tls_verify_client = 1
tls_require_client_certificate = 1
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.10. tls_verify_server=number

   Technically, tls_verify_server activates SSL_VERIFY_PEER in
   the ssl_context.

   This parameter is used for outgoing TLS connections, where
   OpenSIPS acts as client.

   See previous chapter Section 1.5.4 for more information.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is 1. 

   Example 1-10. Set tls_verify_server variable
...
# turn on the strictest and strongest authentication possible
tls_verify_server = 1
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.11. tls_handshake_timeout=number and tls_send_timeout=number

   Timeouts ... advanced users only

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value for both is 30. 

   Example 1-11. Set tls_handshake_timeout & tls_send_timeout
   variable
...
tls_handshake_timeout=119    # number of seconds
tls_send_timeout=121         # number of seconds
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.12. tls_client_domain_avp=number

   This sets the interger AVP used for name based TLS server
   domains (please see tls_client_domain for more details).
   Setting the value to 0 disables name based TLS client domains.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

   Default value is 0. 

   Example 1-12. Set tls_client_domain_avp variable
...
tls_client_domain_avp=400    # only integer named AVPs are supported
...
     _________________________________________________________

1.6.13. tls_server_domain, tls_client_domain section

   If you only run one domain, the main one is enough. If you are
   running several TLS servers (that is, you have more than one
   listen=tls:ip:port entry in the config file), you can specify
   some parameters for each of them separately (not all the
   above).

   The wording 'TLS domain' means that this TLS connection will
   have different parameters than another TLS connection (from
   another TLS domain). Thus, TLS domains must are not directly
   related to different SIP domains, although they are often used
   in common. Depending on the direction of the TLS handshake, a
   TLS domain is called 'client domain' (=outgouing TLS
   connection) or 'server domain' (= incoming TLS connection).

   For example, TLS domains can be used in virtual hosting
   scenarios with TLS. OpenSIPS offers SIP service for multiple
   domains, e.g. atlanta.com and biloxi.com. Altough both domains
   will be hosted a single SIP proxy, the SIP proxy needs 2
   certificates: One for atlanta.com and one for biloxi.com. For
   incoming TLS connections, the SIP proxy has to present the
   respective certificate during the TLS handshake. As the SIP
   proxy does not have received a SIP message yet (this is done
   after the TLS handshake), the SIP proxy can not retrieve the
   target domain (which will be usually retrieved from the domain
   in the request URI). Thus, distinction for these domains must
   be done by using multiple sockets. The socket on which the TLS
   connection is received, identifies the respective domain. Thus
   the SIP proxy is able to present the proper certificate.

   For outgoing TLS connections, the SIP proxy usually has to
   provide a client certificate. In this scenario, socket based
   distinction is not possible as there is no dedicated outgoing
   socket. Thus, the certificate selection (selection of the
   proper TLS client domain) will be name based. For this
   purpose, TLS client domains can be associated with a name
   (e.g. the domain can be used as name). If the SIP proxy
   establishes a new outgoing TLS connection, it checks for the
   TLS client domain AVP (parameter tls_client_domain_avp). If
   this AVP is set (e.g. in OpenSIPS.cfg), OpenSIPS searches for a
   TLS client domain with the same name and uses the certificates
   defined in the respective tls_client_domain section.

   TLS client domains can also be socket based. If name based
   domains are disabled or no name based AVP is found, OpenSIPS
   searches for socket based TLS client domains. In this case the
   mapping between to the TLS client domain is done based on the
   destination socket of the underlying outgoing TCP connection.

   Note: If there is already an existing TLS connection to the
   remote target, it will be reused wether the TLS client domain
   AVP matches or not.

   NOTE: Make sure to also configure OpenSIPS to listen on the
   specified IP:port.

   NOTE: Except tls_handshake_timeout and tls_send_timeout all
   TLS parameters can be set per TLS domain. If a parameter is
   not explicit set, the default value will be used.

   NOTE: The tls_verify_client and tls_require_client_certificate
   options can only be configured in TLS server domains, whereas
   the tls_verify_server option is only valid for configuring TLS
   client domains.

   It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.

1.7. OpenSIPS with TLS - script example

   IMPORTANT: The TLS support is based on TCP, and for allowing
   OpenSIPS to use TCP, it must be started in multi-process mode.
   So, there is a must to have the "fork" parameter set to "yes":

   NOTE: Since the TLS engine is quite memory consuming, increase
   the used memory by the run time parameter "-m" (see OpenSIPS -h
   for more details).

     * fork = yes

Chapter 2. Developer's Guide

2.1. TLS_CONFIG

   It contains configuration variables for OpenSIPS's TLS
   (timeouts, file paths, etc).
     _________________________________________________________

2.2. TLS_INIT

   Initialization related functions and parameters.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.1. ssl context

   extern SSL_CTX *default_client_ctx;

   The ssl context is a member of the TLS domain strcuture. Thus,
   every TLS domain, default and virtual - servers and clients,
   have its own SSL context.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.2. pre_init_tls

   int init_tls(void);

   Called once to pre_initialize the tls subsystem, from the
   main(). Called before parsing the configuration file.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.3. init_tls

   int init_tls(void);

   Called once to initialize the tls subsystem, from the main().
   Called after parsing the configuration file.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.4. destroy_tls

   void destroy_tls(void);

   Called once, just before cleanup.
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.5. tls_init

   int tls_init(struct socket_info *c);

   Called once for each tls socket created, from main.c
     _________________________________________________________

2.2.6. ser_malloc, ser_realloc, ser_free

   Wrapper functions around the shm_* functions. OpenSSL uses
   non-shared memory to create its objects, thus it would not
   work in OpenSIPS. By creating these wrappers and configuring
   OpenSSL to use them instead of its default memory functions,
   we have all OpenSSL objects in shared memory, ready to use.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3. TLS_SERVER

2.3.1. SSL data per connection

   Each TLS connection, incoming or outgoing, creates an SSL *
   object, where configuration inherited from the SSL_CTX * and
   particular info on that socket are stored. This SSL *
   structure is kept in OpenSIPS as long as the connection is
   alive, as part of the "struct tcp_connection *" object:
...
struct tcp_connection *c;
SSL *ssl;

/*create somehow SSL object*/
c->extra_data = (void *) ssl;
ssl = (SSL *) c->extra_data;
...
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.2. tls_print_errstack

   void tls_print_errstack(void);

   Dumps ssl error stack.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.3. tls_tcpconn_init

   int tls_tcpconn_init( struct tcp_connection *c, int fd);

   Called when new tcp connection is accepted
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.4. tls_tcpconn_clean

   void tls_tcpconn_clean( struct tcp_connection *c);

   Shuts down the TLS connection.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.5. tls_blocking_write

   size_t tls_blocking_write( struct tcp_connection *c, int fd,
   const char *buf, size_t len);

   Writes a memory chunk in blocking mode (syncron).
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.6. tls_read

   size_t tls_read( struct tcp_connection *c);

   Reads from a TLS connection. Return the number of bytes read.
     _________________________________________________________

2.3.7. tls_fix_read_conn

   void tls_tcpconn_clean( struct tcp_connection *c);

   Shuts down the TLS connection.
     _________________________________________________________

2.4. TLS_DOMAIN

2.4.1. tls_domains

   extern struct tls_domain *tls_default_server_domain;

   The default TLS server domain.

   extern struct tls_domain *tls_default_client_domain;

   The default TLS client domain.

   extern struct tls_domain *tls_server_domains;

   List with defined server domains.

   extern struct tls_domain *tls_client_domains;

   List with defined client domains.

Chapter 3. Frequently Asked Questions

   3.1. Where can I post a question about TLS?
   3.2. How can I report a bug?
   3.3. How can I debug ssl/tls problems?

   3.1. Where can I post a question about TLS?

   Use one (the most appropriate) of the OpenSIPS mailing lists:

     * User Mailing List -
       http://opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/users
     * Developer Mailing List -
       http://opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel

   Remember: first at all, check if your question wasn't already
   answered.

   3.2. How can I report a bug?

   Accumulate as much as possible information (OpenSIPS version,
   opensips -V output, your OS (uname -a), OpenSIPS logs, network
   dumps, core dump files, configuration file) and send a mail to
   http://opensips.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel

   Also you may try OpenSIPS's bug report web page:
   http://www.opensips.org/pmwiki.php?n=Development.Tracker

   3.3. How can I debug ssl/tls problems?

   Increase the log level in opensips.cfg (debug=4) and watch the
   log statements in syslog.

   Install the ssldump utility and start it. This will give you a
   trace of the ssl/tls connections.
