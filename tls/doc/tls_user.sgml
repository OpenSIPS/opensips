	<section>
		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
		TLS is an optional part of the &ser;'s core, not a module. TLS, as 
		defined in SIP RFC 3261, is a mandatory feature for proxies and can 
		be used to secure the SIP signalling on a hop-by-hop basis 
		(not end-to-end). TLS works on top of TCP. DTLS, or TLS over UDP is 
		already defined by IETF and may become available in the future.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section>
		<title>History</title>
		<para>
		The TLS support was originally developed by Peter Griffiths and posted
		as a patch on SER development mailing list. Thanks to Cesc 
		Santasusana, several problems were fixed and some improvements were 
		added.
		</para>
		<para>
		The TLS support was simultaneously added in both projects. In SER,
		the support was committed in a separate <quote>experimental</quote> 
		CVS tree, as patch to the main CVS tree. In OpenSIPS, the support was
		integrated directly into the CVS tree, as a built-in component, and is
		part of stable OpenSIPS since release >=1.0.0.
		</para>

	<section>
		<title>Scenario</title>
		<para>
		By the increased number of providers the SIP world is continuously 
		growing. More users means more calls and more calls means a high 
		probability for a user to receive calls from totally unknown people 
		or, in the worst case, to receive unwanted calls. To prevent this, a 
		defense mechanism must be adopted by the SIP provider. Since only the 
		called user is fully able to classify a call as being unwanted, the 
		SIP server, based on all information regarding the call should notify
		the user about the desirability of the call. Information like the 
		caller domain, the received source or the incoming protocol can be 
		very useful for a SIP server to establish the nature of the call.
		</para>
		<para>
		As this information is quite limited, is very improbable for a server
		to be able detect the unwanted calls - there are many calls that it 
		cannot predict anything about its status (neutral calls). So, instead 
		on alerting the called user about unwanted calls, the server can 
		notify the user about calls that are considered trusted - calls for 
		which the server is 100% sure there are not unwanted.
		</para>
		<para>
		So, a trust concept must be defined for SIP servers. Which calls 
		are trusted and which are not? A call is trusted if the caller can 
		be identify as a trustable user - a user about we have reliable 
		information.
		</para>
		<para>
		Since all the user from its domain are authenticated (or should be), 
		a SIP server can consider all the calls generated by its user as 
		trusted. Now we have to extend the trust concept to the multi-domain
		level. A mutual agreement, between several domains, can establish a 
		trusting relationship. So, a domain (called A) will consider also as 
		trusted calls all the calls generated by user from a different domain 
		(called B) and vice-versa. But just an agreement is not enough; since 
		the authentication information is strictly limited to a domain 
		(a domain can authenticate only its own user, not the user from other 
		domains), there is still the problem of checking the authenticity of 
		the caller - he can impersonate (by a false FROM header) a user from 
		a domain that is trusted.
		</para>
		<para>
		The answer to this problem is TLS (Transport Layer Security). All 
		calls via domain A and domain B will be done via TLS. Authentication 
		in origin domain plus TLS transport between domains will make the 
		call 100% trusted for the target domain.
		</para>
		<para>
		For such a mechanism to work, the following requirements must be met:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
			<para>
			all UA must have set as outbound proxy their home server.
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>
			all SIP servers must authenticated all the calls generated by 
			their own users.
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>all SIP servers must relay the calls generated be their 
			user to a trusted domain via TLS.
			</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
		Based on this, a server can classify as trusted a call for one of 
		its user only if the call is also generated by one of its users or 
		is the call is received from a trusted domain ( which is equivalent 
		with a call received via TLS). Untrusted call will be calls received 
		from users belonging to untrusted domains or from users from trusted 
		domains, but whose calls are not routed via their home server 
		(so, they are not authenticated by there home servers).
		</para>
		<para>
		Once the server is able to tell if the call is trusted or not, the 
		still open issue is about the mechanism used by server to notify the 
		called user about the nature of the incoming call.
		</para>
		<para>
		One way to do it is by remotely changing the ringing type of the 
		called user's phone. This can be done by inserting special header 
		into the INVITE request. Such feature is supported by now by several 
		hardphones like CISCO ATA, CISCO 7960 and SNOM. This phones can 
		change their ringing tone based on the present or content of the 
		"Alert-Info" SIP header as follows:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>CISCO ATA</emphasis> - it has 4 pre-defined 
			ringing types. The Alert-Info header must look like 
			<quote>Alert-info: Bellcore-drX EOH"</quote> where X can be 
			between 1 and 4. Note that 1 is the phone default ringing tone.
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>CISCO 7960</emphasis> - it has 2 pre-defined 
			ringing types and the possibility of uploading new ones. 
			The <quote>Alert-Info</quote> header must look like 
			<quote>Alert-info: X EOH</quote> where X can be whatever number.
			When this header is present, the phones will not change the 
			ringing tone, but the ringing pattern. Normally, the phone rings 
			like [ring.........ring..........ring] where [ring] is the 
			ringing tone; if the header is present, the ringing pattern will 
			be [ring.ring.........ring.ring........]. So, to be able to hear 
			some difference between the two patterns (and not only as length),
			its strongly recommended to have a highly asymmetric ringing type
			(as the pre-defined are not!!).
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para><emphasis>SNOM</emphasis> - The <quote>Alert-Info</quote>
			header must look like <quote>Alert-info: URL EOH"</quote> where 
			URL can be a HTTP URL (for example) from where the phone can 
			retrieve a ringing tone.
			</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<xref linkend="tls-example">.

		<title>Compiling TLS support</title>
		<para>
		To compile &osips; with the TLS support, the environment variable 
		TLS must be set. Note that this is required for all make commands 
		(and not only for compiling). To set the variable, there are 
		several ways to do it:
		</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
			<para>
			run all make commands like 
			<quote>TLS=1 make all|clean|install|etc</quote>
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>
			before starting, export the TLS variable like 
			<quote>export TLS=1</quote> (in bash) and use the make 
			commands as usual. NOTE: the exported variable will be available
			only in current shell!
			</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
			<para>
			comment (to disable) or uncomment (to enable) the

		<title>TLS setup</title>
		<para>
		TLS provides for strong authentication mechanism, as well as 
		encryption following authentication. Of course, null encryption can 
		be used, as well as weak authentication mechanisms (for example, 
		anonymous, that is, no authentication).
		</para>
		<para>
		How does verification work? Verification is the process by which 
		the authentication data provided by the peers is checked. This data 
		consists usually of a peer certificate, plus a chain of trusted 
		certification authorities. If for whatever reason, either of the 
		peers thinks that the handshake is not valid, the ssl connection is 
		not established. The reasons could be many: untrusted server 
		certificate, too-weak algorithm, invalid client cert, no client 
		authentication, ...
		</para>
		<para>
		This paragraph describe how to generate all the needed keys and 
		certificates for establishing TLS connection with SER. The described
		TLS setup is based on the assumption that we run our own certificate 
		authority (CA) and we want to connect via TLS several &ser; servers 
		(SIP domain).
		</para>
		<warning><para>
		In this setup the private key is not encrypted. The client 
		and server keys must not be encrypted (or else &ser; will ask you for 
		a password on startup or will fail to load the certificates), but 
		you should use a password at least for your CA private key.
		</para></warning>

			The wording 'TLS domain' means that this TLS connection will have different
			parameters than another TLS connection (from another TLS domain). Thus, TLS
			domains must are not directly related to different SIP domains, although they
			are often used in common. Depending on the direction of the TLS handshake, a 
			TLS domain is called 'client domain' (=outgouing TLS connection) or 'server domain'
			(= incoming TLS connection).
			</para>
			<para>
			For example, TLS domains can be used in virtual hosting scenarios with TLS.
			&ser; offers SIP service for multiple domains, e.g. atlanta.com and biloxi.com. Altough
			both domains will be hosted a single SIP proxy, the SIP proxy needs 2 certificates: One
			for atlanta.com and one for biloxi.com. For incoming TLS connections, the SIP proxy
			has to present the respective certificate during the TLS handshake. As the SIP proxy
			does not have received a SIP message yet (this is done after the TLS handshake), the SIP
			proxy can not retrieve the target domain (which will be usually retrieved from the domain in 
			the request URI). Thus, distinction for these domains must be done by using multiple sockets.
			The socket on which the TLS connection is received, identifies the respective domain. Thus 
			the SIP proxy is able to present the proper certificate.
			</para>
			<para>
			For outgoing TLS connections, the SIP proxy usually has to provide a client certificate. In 
			this scenario, socket based distinction is not possible as there is no dedicated outgoing socket.
			Thus, the certificate selection (selection of the proper TLS client domain) will be name based.
			For this purpose, TLS client domains can be associated with a name (e.g. the domain can be 
			used as name). If the SIP proxy establishes a new outgoing TLS connection, it checks 
			for the TLS client domain AVP (parameter tls_client_domain_avp). If this AVP is set (e.g.
			in &ser;.cfg), &osips; searches for a TLS client domain with the same name and uses
			the certificates defined in the respective tls_client_domain section.
			</para>
			<para>
			TLS client domains can also be socket based. If name based domains are disabled or no 
			name based AVP is found, &ser; searches for socket based TLS client domains. In this case	
			the mapping between to the TLS client domain is done based on the destination socket of the 
			underlying outgoing TCP connection.
			</para>
			<para>
			Note: If there is already an existing TLS connection to the remote target, it will be reused
			wether the TLS client domain AVP matches or not.
			</para>
			<para>
			NOTE: Make sure to also configure &ser; to listen on the specified 
			IP:port.
			</para>
			<para>
			NOTE: Except tls_handshake_timeout and tls_send_timeout all TLS parameters can be set
			per TLS domain. If a parameter is not explicit set, the default value will be used.
			</para>
			<para>
			NOTE: The tls_verify_client and tls_require_client_certificate options 
			can only be configured in TLS server domains,
			whereas the tls_verify_server option is only valid for configuring TLS client domains.
			</para>
			<para>
			It's usable only if TLS support was compiled.
