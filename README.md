# Welcome to OpenSIPS Project


## About

OpenSIPS is a GPL licensed SIP server implementation. It started as a fork of
Fokus Fraunhofer SIP Express Router (SER) project. OpenSIPS wants to be a more
open project, not only from license point of view, but more open as project
management, especially for external contributions.

OpenSIPS wants to overcome the development latency of current SER project,
to ensure a shorter path into a release for new added features.
OpenSIPS is a project maintained by OpenSIPS Solutions
           <http://www.opensips-solutions.com/>
by a team including core and main developers of SER project.
