This directory contains an already generated TLS certificate that can be
used in your OpenSIPS configuration. It is a generic certificate with the 
main purpose of serving both as an example and a testing sample.

IMPORTANT: it is not a trustable certificate - the CA is also an example.

All TLS configuration files may be found in the "user" directory. If you want
to generate your own certificate, a CA you may sign your request with can
be found in the "rootCA" directory. Use the "opensips-cli tls userCERT" command
to create a new certificate; the rootCA passphrase is "opensips".

What is the purpose of the default CA and certificate? Firstly, to make an 
out-of-the box TLS configuration for users not so familiar with SSL/TLS.
Secondly, to give access to the same CA root to a large community in order to
encourage testings and interconnections via TLS with a minimum of troubles.
