 behaviour. Its modular architecture allows only required functionality to be
 loaded.
 .
 Among others, the following modules are available: Digest Authentication, CPL
 scripts, Instant Messaging, MySQL support, Presence Agent, Radius
 Authentication, Record Routing, SMS Gateway, Jabber/XMPP Gateway, Transaction
 Module, Registrar and User Location, Load Balaning/Dispatching/LCR,
