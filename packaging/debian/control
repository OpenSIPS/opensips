Description: very fast and configurable SIP server
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 C Shell-like scripting language provides full control over the server's
 behaviour. Its modular architecture allows only required functionality to be
 loaded.
 .
 Among others, the following modules are available: Digest Authentication, CPL
 scripts, Instant Messaging, MySQL support, Presence Agent, Radius
 Authentication, Record Routing, SMS Gateway, Jabber/XMPP Gateway, Transaction
 Module, Registrar and User Location, Load Balaning/Dispatching/LCR,
 XMLRPC Interface.
 .
 This package contains the main OpenSIPS binary along with the principal modules
 and support binaries including opensipsmc configuration tool.

Description: JSON Web Tokens authentication module for OpenSIPS
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 The module implements authentication over JSON Web Tokens. In
 some cases ( ie. WebRTC ) the user authenticates on another
 layer ( other than SIP ), so it makes no sense to
 double-authenticate it on the SIP layer. Thus, the SIP client
 will simply present the JWT auth token it received from the
 server, and pass it on to OpenSIPS which will use that for
 authentication purposes. It relies on two DB tables, one
 containing JWT profiles ( a profile name and it's SIP username
 associated to it ) and one containing JWT secrets. Each secret
 has a corresponding profile, the KEY used for signing the JWT
 and two timestamps describing a validation interval. Multiple
 JWT secrets can point to the same JWT profile.
