	* [5570] :

	backport from trunk (rev #5568):

	  Closes bug 2649267.
	  Many thanks to Bobby Smith for helping with debugging this!


2009-04-01 21:04:26  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at voice-system dot ro>

	* [5579] :

	backport from trunk (rev #5578):
	- fixed bug in resetting the prepared statements when a text-based query triggers an auto reconnect - the problem was that both mysql_ping() and mysql_real_query() do not report the reconnect event at all (if auto reconnect is set).


2009-04-06 11:31:42  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at voice-system dot ro> 
	* [5581] :

	- backport from trunk (rev #5580):

	- workaround a bug in mysql clinet lib - it looks like the mysql_stmt_execute() crashes if the mysql server is down (on "Can't connect to local MySQL server" error) - see http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=43560
	  What I did is to have as screen function the mysql_ping() function - this will detect the error (disconnect state) and prevent executing the bogus mysql_stmt_execute(). It is no the nicest fix, but it fixes the crash.

	 Reported by Thomas Gelf.
