2012-03-21 18:36:58  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8811] :

	TM will no longer do retransmission for the 407/401 replies (if no ACK is received) for both local or proxied replies.

	According to RFC 3261, retransmitting 407s/401s is probably a bad idea:

	26.3.2.4 DoS Protection

	<snip/>

	UAs and proxy servers SHOULD challenge questionable requests with
	only a single 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication
	Required), forgoing the normal response retransmission algorithm, and
	thus behaving statelessly towards unauthenticated requests.

	Retransmitting the 401 (Unauthorized) or 407 (Proxy Authentication
	Required) status response amplifies the problem of an attacker
	using a falsified header field value (such as Via) to direct
	traffic to a third party.

	In summary, the mutual authentication of proxy servers through
	mechanisms such as TLS significantly reduces the potential for rogue
	intermediaries to introduce falsified requests or responses that can
	deny service. This commensurately makes it harder for attackers to
	make innocent SIP nodes into agents of amplification.


	Credits for original patch to "David".
	Closed patch #3496382

2012-03-21 14:39:20  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8808] :

Added support for variables in the acc_*_request methods exported by the acc module. It also supplies a default reason if just a sip code is accounted.
	Examples:
		acc_db_request("$T_reply_code $(<reply>rr)");
		#This will be accounted with the reason 'Not Found'
		acc_db_request("404");

	Closes Patch #3504627

2012-03-05 20:13:54  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8763] :

	This patch adds support for includes and imports within the configuration file(s). These can be nested within each other and recursive up to 10 levels, which is simply a limitation set in the code. All loading is done at config parsing startup and does not effect server performance. The two new core functions added, described in detail below. Enhancements also upgrade error functions to show config file in addition other error details on parsing error(s).

	Work derived from the great parser enhancements made by Daniel-Constantin Mierla to the sip-router project.

	Purpose of patch/enhancement ::

	This patch will make working with large configs much easier. It also hopes to achieve some modularity when working with large projects/installations by abstracting parts of the logic into individual files.

	Description of new core functions ::

	include_file:
	example: include_file "proxy_regs.cfg"
	details: Can be called from outside route blocks to load additional routes/blocks or from inside them to simply preform more functions. The file path can be relative or absolute. If it is not an absolute path, first attempt is to locate it relative to current directory. If that fails, second try is relative to directory of the file that includes it. Will throw an error if file is not found.

	import_file:
	example: import_file "proxy_checks.cfg"
	details: Same as include_file but will not throw an error if file is not found.

2012-03-05 19:58:40  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8760] :

	- added patch to provides TCP keepalive to OpenSIPS. During testing we found that if a TCP connection is kept idle on one direction for a long time some routers would half close it, so even if all clients usually send TCP keepalives it's also good to do it from the server side.

	The patch adds 4 new core configuration options:
	- tcp_keepalive (boolean): enable / disable TCP keepalive
	- tcp_keepcount: number of keepalives to send before closing the connection (Linux only)
	- tcp_keepidle: amount of time before OpenSIPS will start to send keepalives if the connection is idle (Linux only)
	- tcp_keepinterval: interval between keepalive probes, if the previous one failed (Linux only)
