===================== Changes since release 0.9.4 ============================

* 2005-10-00 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
* 2005-10-00 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
* 2005-10-00 Elena-Ramona Modroiu <ramona@voice-system.ro>
- modules' documentation updated to list the route types where the exported
  functions can be used

* 2005-09-15 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- maxfwd: max_limit of MAX-FORWARDS cannot exceed 256 (as per RFC)

* 2005-09-11 Klaus Darilion <klaus.mailinglists@pernau.at>
- postgres: adding transaction rollback for failed queries (postgres module
  encapsulates every query into transaction. If the query failed, the
  transcation was not finished, thus a new database connection was created
  on the next query)

* 2005-09-09 Elena-Ramona Modroiu <ramona@voice-system.ro>
- avpops: avp_write() allow $hdr(name) to be coherent with avp_printf()
- avpops: old format $hdr[name] is still valid

* 2005-09-07 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- tm: t_flush_flags() - flush to T (UAS side) only the global flags

* 2005-09-07 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- core: return code is printed to a string as signed int (was printed unsigned
  until now)

* 2005-09-06 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>
- domain: is_uri_host_local() can now be called also from failure route,
  where it checks host part of first branch (which thus must have been earlier
  appended to the transaction)

* 2005-09-05 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- acc: DB support is compiled by default
- acc: DB support disabled by default (db_url=0)
- tm: inconsistency in "tw_append: parameter definition fixed: "msg(body)"
  proprietary specifier migrated to $rb pseudo variable; message body must
  be deal separately since it have a special status in the fifo/unix syntax.

* 2005-09-01 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>
- lcr: Request-URI user part can be modified between load_gws() and first
  next_gw() calls.

* 2005-09-03 Elena-Ramona Modroiu <ramona@voice-system.ro>

- core: full suppor for per-branch flags
- registrar: may use the branch flags for NAT marking
- registrar: new module parameter "use_branch_flags": if enabled the branch
  flags will be used for NAT flag.
- tm: new param "branch_flag_mask" which defined which flags shall be
  considered to be branch flags; it's bit mask in 2, 10 or 16 base;

* 2005-09-02 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>
- core: new global parameter 'log_name' to set the id to be printed in
  syslog - the value must be a string and has effect only when openser runs
  in daemon mode (fork=yes), after daemonize. Default value is argv[0].

* 2005-09-01 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>
- auth: append_rpid_hf function can now be called from branch_route block.

* 2005-08-31 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: "drop" statement has special meaning in some route types (by default
  it's equivalent to "exit"):
    - BRANCH ROUTE - the request branch is discarded (not fwd);
    - ONREPLY ROUTE - if provisional reply (<200), it will be discarded (not
      fwd, not stored, but only timers updated)

* 2005-08-29 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: new internal core function for checking if a module function may or
  may be not called from a script route (based on route type); all route
  inclusions are followed, but avoiding potential loops.
- core: new command line parameter (-C) - similar to (-c), but additioanly
  force the above described checking. (-C implies -c)
- tm: t_was_cancelled() - says if the transaction was cancelled or
  not from the UAC side.
- tm: request fwd functions break if the transaction was already cancelled.
- cpl-c: CPL interpreter stop floowing the negative replies in proxy node if
  the INVITE was cancelled.

* 2005-08-29 Juha Heinanen <jh@tutpro.com>
- auth: append_rpid_hf function can now be called from branch_route block.

* 2005-08-26 Daniel-Constantin Mierla <daniel@voice-system.ro>

    - $rP - transport protocol of RURI
    - $dd - dst_uri domain
    - $dp - dst_uri port
    - $dP - dst_uri transport protocol
- core: new core functions to manage next hop destination address (dst_uri)
    - setdsturi("uri") - set the value of dst_uri - the value of the parameter
      must be a valid sip uri
    - resetdsturi() - reset dst_uri
    - isdsturiset() - test if there is a dst_uri address set
- avpops: avp_write() and avp_pushto() can access and set dst_uri field (if
  set, this is the next hop, regardless of r-uri address) via '$duri'

* 2005-08-25 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: in failure route will be visible the RURI of the selected branch
  (so far was all the time the RURI of the first branch).
- core: dst_uri (per branch) available in branch route - it can be also changed

* 2005-08-24 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- tm: new function t_check_trans(): checks if the request belongs to a
  transacation as follows:
     - non-CANCEL;non-ACK - checks if the the transaction already exists
       (retransmission)
     - ACK - returns true if it's local e2e ACK; false otherwise;
     - CANCEL - returns true if the coresponding INVITE transaction exists.

* 2005-08-23 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- core: branch_route[] support added (route blocks to be executed for each
  branch)

- tm: local builded requests (CANCEL and ACK) use UAC info (instead of UAS)
  if FL_USE_UAC_TO or FL_USE_UAC_CSEQ flags are set
- uac: proper TO mangling in sequential request due FROM magling in initial
  request. By this, FROM mangling may be used in full automatic mode - all
  sequential replies and requests (in all directions) will be automatically
  fixed.

* 2005-08-15 Bogdan-Andrei Iancu <bogdan@voice-system.ro>
- tm: delayed CANCEL feature added - cancelled transactions will be marked to be
  able to cancel delayed replies

  API)

  selective)
