	after the rework that changed the storage of the context to be

	used for matching the certificates instead.

2020-11-11  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [96d97eea2] :

	tm: Fix transaction leakage with global onreply_route
	Given that the opensips.cfg execution order for replies is:
	    1) onreply_route (global)
	    2) reply_received(), i.e. "tm" module scope
	      2.1) onreply_route (branch)
	      2.2) onreply_route (transaction)

	... this patch fixes some transaction leaks where if the script developer
	matches the current transaction within global onreply_route, e.g. with a
	random statement such as xlog("$T_reply_code\n"), it would cause an
	extra ref after a transaction matching operation would be performed yet
	again (??) within reply_received(), as the "tm" scope begins executing.

	The fix is to simply avoid transaction lookups when evaluating tm
	variables within the non-transactional, global SIP reply route.

	Credits to Bogdan-Andrei Iancu for suggesting this solution
	(cherry picked from commit 3a25c0b28f9bffc5e6942a7a3f5484ef903e28f6)


2020-11-10  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [b14a7eaff] :

	mid_registrar_save(): Fix shm memleak with no t_relay()
	Since mid_registrar_save() is stateful by definition, it needs the SIP
	transaction to properly function, so always forcing its creation if the
	REGISTER is about to be forwarded is not that significant of a change,
	if any at all.

	Thus, this patch fixes a SHM memleak on the following type of logic:

	    mid_registrar_save();

	    # script terminates without having created the transaction,
	    # so mid_registrar's "prepped" data does not get freed on T deletion
	    exit;

	* [e85b96028] :

2020-11-06  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [fe7e1e217] :

	usrloc: Add the "req_callid" field to contact refresh events
	Providing the Call-ID of the pending SIP request during the Push
	Notification event_route execution gives the ability to load the dialog
	context of the pending INVITE.  From here onwards, data can be freely
	passed between the two execution contexts and included in the Push
	Notification body (e.g.: caller ID, callee number, dialog Call-ID, etc.)

	acc: Fix prepared statements for the missed/acc tables
	Commit 4bc134fe3b introduced a regression where the reused PS for the
	"missed_calls" table (9 fields) would no longer match the PS for the
	"acc" table (11 fields).  By reusing the former PS array, which is
	shorter than required, the code would segfault.  Example scenario:

	    * simple call from A -> B with:
	        * do_accounting("db", "missed|failed")
	        * call failure (e.g. 408 Request Timeout)
	    * code crashes as soon as the "failed" acc entry is written

	This issue is fixed in 3.2+ using a different mechanism (separate build
	of the lib/reg/reg.a library).

	topo_hiding: always allocate space for DID in user
	When contact could not be parsed, the new Contact's prefix was not
	allocating bytes in buffer for storing for the dialog ID in the user
	part. However, the DID was appended to the prefix without any error
	checks, resulting in a memory corruption. This commit always allocates
	spaces for storing the Dialog ID, even if the contact could not be
	parsed.
	This fixes all uses of the topology_hiding() function with the `D` flag.

	Thanks a lot Sergei Lavrov (@ccppprogrammer) for reporting this in
	ticket #2285 and for offering information for figure it out. Close #2285

	* [27d5862fb] :

	SIP digest auth: Improve handling for multiple digest challenges
	Before this patch, OpenSIPS would always work with the digest
	credentials of the 1st WWW/Proxy-Authenticate header field.

	While RFC 3261 does not define the behavior with multiple
	WWW/Proxy-Authenticate headers, in Â§ 22.3 it is stated that:

	   Note that if an authentication scheme that does not support realms is
	   used in the Proxy-Authorization header field, a proxy server MUST
	   attempt to parse all Proxy-Authorization header field values to
	   determine whether one of them has what the proxy server considers to
	   be valid credentials.

	... so a proxy must _walk_ through unacceptable headers until it finds
	one with "valid" credentials.  In the context of the upcoming RFC 8760,
	this would also mean: finding an auth header field with an MD5 digest
	algorithm, which is the only one currently supported.

	TL;DR: this patch improves the "uac", "uac_registrant" and
	"b2b_entities" modules so they correctly process 3 WWW-Authenticate
	headers with the following algorithm preference:
	    algorithm=SHA-512-256
	    algorithm=SHA-256
	    algorithm=MD5

	... and correctly build an MD5-based response for the 3rd header field.

	* [df67bac58] :

	Fix next_hop crash (seen in nathelper nh_timer) due to reading reused mem
	Problem:

	- get_domain_db_ucontacts (through get_domain_ucontacts) was handing out
	  (next_hop) pointers to memory that was unused. This resulted in a
	  crash when this memory was reused before the invalid pointer was
	  reused.

	Relevant issues and commits:

	- #1652 [OpenSIPS crashes since of child that serves rtpproxy]
	- e162f5f10 [fix 1652: usrloc: make next_hop point within the shared buffer]
	- #1710 [nathelper next_hop off by one for usrloc path]
	- 0300eb1d5 [fix 1710 / revert 1652: usrloc: fix next hop compute for ...]

	That is: e162f5f10 fixes this exact problem in get_domain_db_ucontacts, in
	get_domain_mem_ucontacts and in get_domain_cdb_ucontacts (cdb_pack_ping_data).

	But in 0300eb1d5 it is reverted for only get_domain_db_ucontacts.

	This fix:

	- Rewrites the fix for get_domain_db_ucontacts and
	  get_domain_cdb_ucontacts, making it less fragile/bug-prone.
	- Adds comments about fragility to get_domain_mem_ucontacts
	- Fixed unaligned memcpy that might affect non-intel CPUs:
	  `((struct proxy_l *)cp)->name.s = next_hop_host`

	Bug reported and fix tested by Jasper Hafkenscheid @hafkensite (VoIPGRID).

	fraud_detection: Add the possibility to disable stats
	A (0) value for any of the fraud detection thresholds now means: "ignore

	threshold?!".  Although (0) values could, in theory, have been useful
	for event generation testing purposes before this patch, this is a small
	price to pay in order to gain the ability to disable a stat.  Developers
	can now add 1 more CPS and still keep testing with a new (1) value :)

	Although the DB schema changes slightly, due to the added "DEFAULT 0",
	it is fully backwards-compatible with the previous one, except
	fraud_detection row INSERTs will now be more quiet, generating no more
	warnings from the backend (e.g. "Column does not have a default
	value..." -> but still defaults to 0, thanks to non-strict mode, leading
	to strange warnings from the module).

	* [5ebea059d] :

	Fixed uac_auth() on sequential requests in dialogs were uac_auth() was already used
	The fix solves the conflict between the changes over the cseq value coming from (1) dialog module, trying to increment the cseq to compensate the cseq change during INVITE auth and (2) the uac module incrementing the cseq again because of auth'ing a sequential request.

	The solution was to first indetify such case in uac_auth() and to use a larger delete lump (when replacing the cseq) in uac_auth(). Such a larger/wider delete lump will invalidate the lump added by the dialog module.

	This is a follow up on #1969

	* [f975e3f7b] :

	Code quality: Use str_match() instead of !str_strcmp()
	Reasons behind this change:
	    - better performance: str_strcmp() includes lots of redundant checks
	      and performs worse than the simplistic str_match()

	    - safer code: although by making this change we increase the chance
	      of a segfault (if either "a" or "b" strings are NULL), the crash
	      will immediately indicate the coding bug and will be easy to
	      troubleshoot.  By the same argument, nobody complains that
	      memset() or strcmp() include zero NULL checks: they don't have to!

	    - more meaningful code: logically speaking, in most cases, the
	      programmer simply intends to _match_ two strings, rather than to
	      order them lexicographically...

	* [f218c3637] :

	rr: Fix ordering issues with add_rr_param() and create_dialog()
	Commits bd1719dcf and c263182ee4d introduced regressions for
	record_route() and record_route_preset(), respectively, which caused
	add_rr_param() to not work anymore in the following sequence of function
	calls:

	create_dialog() with a "dlg_match_mode" != DID_NONE
	record_route() or record_route_preset()
	add_rr_param() # would not do anything, simply acting as a NOP

	The reason is that the "fake" lump chain which was meant to hold
	all add_rr_param() operations prior to an eventual record_route() call
	would no longer be masked after the record_route() and would continue to
	accumulate data from subsequent add_rr_param() calls.  Since it was
	meant to be a "fake" chain from the beginning (maybe the user doesn't
	call record_route() at all!), the data would simply be lost.

	Many thanks to John Quick for the accurate report and instructions on
	how to reproduce the issue!

	* [2ffd96f97] :

	Fix wrong type of lumps.
	As the eoh (Enf Of Header) is determined during the on-demand parsing, the add_lump() may wrongly lable a lump as "header" or "body" (as the add_lump() may be used before the parsing reached the EOH).
	So, better identify all headers asap, so the add_lump() will properly work all the time. This will not add any overhead, as in 99.9999% of the case, due the functions used in cfg, anyhow you end up parsing the whole message.

	Fixes  #2144
	This is a 100% safe fix, there are 0 chances for side effects.

	SIP PN: Refine Feature-Caps hf building logic
	The Feature-Caps content is not meant to be symmetrical for

	    * on downstream-forwarded REGISTER, we leak a _minimal_ amount of
	      information.  For example, just that we support "apns" PNs and
	      that the element MUST NOT send PNs anymore to it, e.g.:
	         Feature-Caps: +sip.pns="apns"

	    * on upstream-forwarded 200 OK which are not PN capability queries,
	      we include _maximal_ amounts of information into the Feature-Caps,
	      fully informing the UA of our supported parameters, e.g.:
	         Feature-Caps: +sip.pns="apns";+sip.pnsreg="130";
	                       +sip.pnspurr="3a0.94000.00001921"

	* [fc6f8f040] :

	rest_client: Disable "Expect: 100-continue" by default
	Although the "100 Continue" flow sometimes saves bandwidth when the
	server replies with an error response, it also has some drawbacks:

	    * extra roundtrips, adding latency and complicating the async
	        handling
	    * the client body upload and server body download must be performed
	        within the same curl_multi_perform() loop, during the async
		resume callback, limiting the amount of parallelism that can be
		obtained when compared to the simple flow

	From now on, the "100 Continue" flow for POST/PUT requests with bodies
	larger than 1024 bytes is disabled by default.  Developers may enable it
	using a new, backwards-compatible, "enable_expect_100" module parameter.

	Fixes #2081

	stir_shaken: use the proper signature format
	Use the raw octet sequence of the R and S integer components instead
	of the DER encoding as the signature value before base64 encoding.

	Reported by Alexandru Tripon.


2020-04-14  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [bfdc1e34f] :

	Docs updated with dialoginfo_mute_branch()


2020-04-14  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [fb3736599] :

	Added new dialoginfo_mute_branch() function.
	This function mutes the publishing for a certain branch of the call (to be used from branch route). The muting may be total (caller and callee) or only for caller or callee (controlled via the optional param of the function).


2020-04-14  BjÃ¶rn Esser  <besser82 at fedoraproject dot org>
	* [65ba3d4c7] :

	Add support for upcoming json-c 0.14.0.
	TRUE/FALSE are not defined anymore.  1 and 0 are used instead.


2020-04-13  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [dec009ee2] :

	Improve canceling of transactions doing only t_wait_for_new_branches().
	If a transaction has no real signalling branch, but only doing t_wait_for_new_branches(), upon caller cancel inject a 487 reply on the phony/waiting branch in order to terminate the transaction on the spot.
	The provious behavior was to wait (even after the cancel) for the phony/waiting branch timeout (fr_inv_timeout) and to generate an 408 timeout.
	Now, there is no useless waiting and a proper 487 is generated.
	(cherry picked from commit 8af80a40bb9877b91380da670353a68c53f0a36b)


2020-04-13  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [ddc2ac911] :

	Fix un-released transaction upon t_wait_for_new_branches + cancel.
	If t_wait_for_new_branches() is used and no real signaling branch is added, the caller canceling must not be ignored upon branch selection. The injected 408 timeout on the phony branch must be considered, leading the transaction termination.

	Thanks to Chris Maciejewski for reporting and providing troubleshooting info.
	Also thanks to Razvan Crainea ( @razvancrainea ) for investigating and reproducing the problem.
	(cherry picked from commit 7221b984d555cb68fd07e1bfb502607446345d42)


2020-04-13  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [fa4e4fa70] :

	Fix compilation warnings with -DUSE_FUTEX
	It seems that whenever "time.h" is included without first enabling
	_GNU_SOURCE, including "unistd.h" afterwards will leave the "syscall"

	HP_MALLOC: Aggregate SHM statistic updates
	It is better to update the stats with a diff of the
	attached/detached/split/merged fragment changes.  Updating the stats in
	a "step by step" manner has the side-effect of creating temporarily
	bogus values. (i.e. negative "used" and/or "real_used")

	Many thanks to 46Labs for supporting this work!


2020-04-03  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0d6d33e58] :

	HP_MALLOC: Add "re-scanning" logic
	Given that HP_MALLOC has fine-grained locking, if the big fragment
	shifts down from hash bucket N to bucket N-1 due to another
	process performing the allocation, we may actually "lose" it during
	our own scan, since bucket N-1 was empty and we're now waiting
	for bucket N to unlock.  When it does unlock, it will also be empty.

	As a solution: retry the scan up to N times, as long as it's feasible!

	Many thanks to 46Labs for supporting this work!

2020-04-03  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [fc9344a5b] :

	HP_MALLOC:  Dramatically reduce memory fragmentation
	For HP_MALLOC to offer optimal parallel allocation performance, it
	needs the memory to be fragmented: the more available chunks, the better
	its performance.  However, there needs to be some coalescing as well,
	otherwise variable-length allocations past the 10K range will
	quickly deplete (fragment) even SHM pools of 10+ GB.

	This patch adds the following heuristics to HP_MALLOC and HP_MALLOC_DBG:

	    * shm_malloc(): only split a fragment if the resulting chunk is at
	      least MIN_SPLIT_SIZE bytes (default 256 for PKG, 4096 for SHM)
	    * shm_free(): try to coalesce the next fragment (enough to fix all
	      fragmentation issues)

	Many thanks to 46Labs for supporting this work!

2020-03-25  Vlad Patrascu  <vladp at opensips dot org>
	* [25d37b692] :

	dialog: fix a replicated profiles counting issue
	The incorrect profile counting was caused by a race between the processing of
	the replicated dialog create/update packets. While processing the create
	packet, the lock was released before linking the dialog into a profile and
	setting the sharing tag. As such, the process that handled the update packet
	could insert the dialog into a profile itself, but with an improper sharing tag.

	Thanks to 46Labs for reporting and help with troubleshooting this!

	The main process (attendant) is no longer running the child_init()
	The main proc must stay free of any db connections, so it can later fork and child_init() other procs (due auto_scaling).
	For the modules which were keeping a DB conn open in main proc for later usage, during module destroy, the new approach is to open the conn, on the spot, in the destroy handler.

	dialog: do not update topo hiding advertised contact
	This commit fixes a bug introduced by commit 7b7a9fc2bf, that was
	updating the contact *after* topology hiding has replaced it. This bug
	would be triggered when a re-INVITE/UPDATE was triggered on a call that
	had topology hiding enabled - in these scenarios OpenSIPS would re-learn
	the contact advertised by topology hiding, that is OpenSIPS itself,
	resulting in looped sequential requests.

2020-03-12  Vlad Paiu  <vladpaiu at opensips dot org>
	* [547717bce] :

	Added AUTH_JWT module
	In some cases ( ie. WebRTC ) the user authenticates on another
	layer ( eg. on the actual website ), so it makes no sense to
	double-authenticate it on the SIP layer.
	Thus, the WebRTC client will simply present the JWT auth token
	it received from the server, and pass it on to
	OpenSIPS ( ie. Authorization: Bearer jwt_token_here )
	which will use that for authentication purposes.

	For example, some possibly useful custom stats for a gateway which may

	b2b_entities: don't try to insert in db nonprintable param
	The b2b_entities module expects that the parameter provided during
	entity registrations to be a string. It stores this string in the
	database. However, there are cases where modules (such as siprec) force
	their parameter to be a pointer to a structure, therefore the string
	becomes non-printable. This breaks certain entities insertion in the
	database.
	This commit prevents the module from inserting a key that's not
	printable. In the case of siprec this is not a problem, since the module
	does not rely on the value that's stored in the parameter for restart -
	it rebuilds the value anyway.

	This is a temorary fix - ideally, the parameter should be able to be
	serialized before written in the database; although this is not possible
	now, it will be possible starting with 3.1. Hence this temporary fix.

	GCC 10 started to use -no-common by default. Here is an official

	* https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html#common

	We have to mark all the declarations of global variables with extern
	keyword and put the definitions into a proper file.


2020-02-08  Peter Lemenkov  <lemenkov at gmail dot com>
	* [242903711] :

	Add missing typedef keyword
	Without this keyword these struct definitions are considered by GCC as a

	This was catched because there is a more strict check about these
	variable definitions since GCC 10:

2020-02-07  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [628a126fe] :

	cfg syntax: Fix all complex assignment operators
	The opensips.cfg now fully supports the non-trivial assignment
	operators, such as: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |= and ^=.  Syntactially,
	they were supported until now, but were actually unimplemented (more
	precisely, they were equivalent to the "=" operator).

	Only the "+=" operator can also work with strings, for example:

	    $var(x) = "foo";
	    $var(x) += "-bar"; # now contains "foo-bar"

	    $rU = "+40";
	    $rU += "729" + "884950"; # now contains "+40729884950"

	All of them (including "+="), work with integers:

	    $var(i) = 0;
	    $var(i) += 2; # 2
	    $var(i) *= 3; # 6
	    $var(i) /= 6; # 1
	    ...


2020-02-07  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [536e7b065] :

	cfg syntax: Enhance the 'return' statement
	The opensips.cfg now additionally allows syntax such as:

	    * return 1;
	    * return +2;
	    * return -3;
	    * return $var(foo);


2020-02-07  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [72fba8416] :

	cfg syntax: Disallow esoteric if/while syntax
	The opensips.cfg no longer accepts constructs such as:

	    if $var(foo) {
	        ...
	    }

	    if [ $var(foo) == 2 ]
	        xlog("bar\n");

	    while $var(foo) < 10 {
		...
	    }

	... and forces the condition to be paranthesized.  Aside from any
	consistency considerations, this change also allows us to disambiguate
	the if-if-else shift/reduce conflicts of the grammar, which were so far
	masked using the "expect 2" rule.

	Refactor the "qr_profiles" code so it can be reloadable.  Also, after

2020-02-06  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [2e9c22fec] :

	qrouting: Drop the gateway disabling concept
	A gateway should _only_ be discounted from routing if it is dead (no
	ping replies!), and not because it received a poor rating from qrouting.
	On such a worst case, it is better to simply demote the gateway to the
	last position in the sorted list.  This way, we don't risk breaking
	connectivity.

	* [a2f4f80fd] :

	event_flatstore: improve handling of multiple subscriptions for the same file
	Use the same internal shm struct corresponding to a file for each evi
	subscription for that file. This fixes an issue with the 'evi_flat_rotate' MI
	command not properly "rotating" multiple subscriptions to the new file. Besides,
	a file is now opened only once regardless of how many subscribtions there are
	for the same file.
	Also, do not reuse an old 'evi_reply_sock' structure for a new subscription for
	the same file (if the file corresponding to an old subscription was not yet
	closed by all processes). This led to incorrect expire times for new
	subscriptions.

	acc:  Fix usage of $acc_* vars in global onreply_route
	This patch fixes a bug where if the script writer reads or writes to
	$acc_extra or $acc_leg within the global (stateless) onreply_route, the
	stateful onreply routes will no longer see the $acc_* vars function
	properly, as acc will be working on a temporary (empty) context.

	The solution is to simply merge and drop this temporary acc context as
	soon as the transaction matching is done and the "real" accounting
	context is extracted from it.

	An interesting side-effect is that the $acc_* variables may now also be
	initialized globally, within onreply_route, and their value will still
	be carrier over to the lower-level onreply_routes, as well as until the
	end of the dialog.

	dialog: fix dlg_end_dlg local_route execution
	Before this commit, when running any flavor of `dlg_end_dlg` from an
	external process (not a SIP worker), the command that was generating the
	BYE messages (tm's `t_request_within`) was dispatching the job to a SIP
	worker, using IPC dispatch. This means that the BYE messages were
	created in a different process than the initial one, thus not exposing a
	proper context in `local_route`, but a dangling one, whichever was not
	properly cleaned up after a request was processed. This resulted in
	bogus data, such as inexisting `$DLG_dir` output, or even worse,
	whatever broken values were leftover in the dangling context.

	This commit fixes this issue by dispatching every `dlg_end_dlg` job
	to a SIP worker, thus creating and populating the dialog context
	properly.

	This command affects any function that can be run through MI, or from an
	external process such as:
	* MI dlg_end_dlg
	* MI profile_end_dlgs
	* RTPProxy/RTPengine timeout notifications

	Credits go to Darpan Patel for reporting this issue on GitHub
	Fix #1896

	proto_smpp: make sure fields do not overlap
	SMPP C-Octet String is defined as a limited number of characters,
	followed by a NULL terminator. This means that a SMPP field consisting
	of maximum N characters, can only have N-1 useful data + 1 NULL
	terminator.

	However, in real life, some operators require 9 length passwords, which
	result in 10 chars password fields, which conflicts with the SMPP
	specification. Check this thread for more information (yeah, I know
	it's old, but it is still relevant):
	https://devel.kannel.narkive.com/iyzAKxzC/smpp-maximum-password-length

	This commit "breaks" a bit the SMPP 3.4 specs, allowing data to have N
	characters _without_ the NULL termination, resulting in N+1 fields tops
	(i.e. the password field can have 9 chars + '\0' = 10 chars). Although
	this is not 100% correct, this makes our module more flexible, because
	if you don't need 9-long passwords, it will be just fine. So the specs
	are broken *only* if the provider requires it.

	This commit also fixes a bug (described in ticket #1867), where OpenSIPS
	was not storing a NULL termination for certain strings in their internal
	storage, resulted in strings concatenated together in resulted messages.

	tm: dup in pkg the faked msg headers
	before this commit, the faked reqests were having the headers fields
	stored in shm_mem and shared with the tm request uas. Thus, during
	concurrent accesses to one of the headers' `parsed` field, the first
	process would have parsed the field in pkg memory, and the second
	process would have found that header already parsed. However, it
	couldn't read the other's process memory, resulting in an invalid
	access.
	Moving the headers in a private area for the faked request solves this
	issue, as each process will have its own `parsed` field in pkg memory.

	mk_proxy(): Improve robustness
	A lot of code which calls mk_proxy() for DNS resolution assumes that
	the "proxy->host->h_addr_list" array contains at least one value, e.g.:

	modules/drouting/routing.c +611:
	    hostent2ip_addr(&pgw->ips[0], &proxy->host, proxy->addr_idx);

	This would cause a segfault immediately if h_addr_list contains 0
	results (i.e. first value is a NULL pointer).  As the overall intention
	is to resolve the hostname into at least 1 IP address, this patch
	changes mk_proxy() to return NULL on a successful query with 0 results.

	When using `sql_mode` is set to `SQL_WRITE_BACK` and  `rr_persist` is `RRP_LOAD_FROM_SQL` contacts are not
	immediately deleted from memory, contacts are marked `expires = UL_EXPIRED_TIME`. So when a `REGISTER` request
	is received following an UNREGISTER, do not return the previous contact marked for deletion.

	Additionally, since the sync packet format has changed (an extra integer

	compatibility issues with OpenSIPS nodes without this patch.

	One of those pesky bugs, caused by not knowing your snprintf's well...
	This strange, seemingly inexplicable bug only manifested whenever a
	series of config file lines + preprocessor tokens formed a multiple
	of 4096 bytes, the amount by which the preprocessor buffer gets extended
	with each reallocation.

	With such config files, the snprintf() would truncate the last byte of

	a '\0' instead, after which the preprocessing continued normally.

	However, it seems Yacc isn't too happy when you feed it with a buffer
	which includes '\0' characters, as this will cause it to barf some

	dialog: run loaded callback for dialogs loaded from db
	Fixes a bug introduced in commit 8c8f27f that was relying on the fact
	that dialogs were loaded from db *before* registering the loaded
	callback, due to the dependencies mechanism. Thus the loaded callback
	was ran on the spot, when the it was registered.

	However, this is not entirely correct, since there are modules (such as
	acc module) that do not have dialog dependencies, but still register
	LOADED dialogs - in these cases, if dialog was loaded (in script) after
	the module itself, the callback was never run. This behavior was
	amplified by commit 3ddae43, which was basically never loading the
	dialogs before registering the callback, thus the loaded callbacks were
	never ran.

	The purpose of this commit is to fix this issue, reported in #1754

	rest_client:  Let libcurl use the system malloc functions
	The fact that libcurl spawns a thread in order to perform each transfer
	is well known.  Also known was the fact that by instructing libcurl to
	use the pkg_*alloc() functions, an OpenSIPS worker must synchronize with
	the libcurl thread before they can both manipulate the PKG pool.  Commit
	900f6c996c697b was an attempt to solve this, however the fix DOES NOT
	hold, as it was implemented in that commit (the curl thread is aware of
	the thread lock while the original process ignores it...).

	The only way we can make libcurl use the opensips pkg mem allocation
	functions is by changing pkg_malloc() itself to also grab a thread
	lock.  And this is already too much, as it would unnecessarily slow down
	the pkg allocator, while the benefits are minimal anyway: what do we
	stand to gain if libcurl uses our mem pool?  Close to nothing.

	We just let libcurl use the system memory manager (along with as much
	memory as it wants) and we're done with this issue for good.

2019-07-08  Dan Pascu  <dan at ag-projects dot com>
	* [1ca0501eb] :

	Refactored presence/rls configuration for specifying the Contact URI
	Removed the server_address modparam and replaced it with contact_user.
	The server_address was used to specify the URI for the Contact header
	and it was optional for presence but mandatory for rls.

	The idea of manually locking the Contact URI to a fixed value that is
	specified in the configuration is non-functional in any setup that
	involves the proxy listening on more than 1 IP/port/transport combo.

	In the new model, the only configurable part of the Contact URI is the
	username part, that can be specified through the contact_user modparam,
	while the rest of the elements of the URI are automatically determined
	from the interface where the request was recevied or sent from.

	* [11884b237] :

	dispatcher: Swap ds_mark_dst() parameters [BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE]
	In 3.0, ds_mark_dst() had its parameters swapped by mistake, without any
	real benefit in doing so, both breaking backwards-compatibility and also
	leading to uglier script, such as:

	    ds_mark_dst(, "p");

	This commit simply reverts the function to its previous behavior,
	addressing both issues above.  Hopefully, I don't upset too many people
	who migrated to 3.0 during this month following the stable release.

2019-05-27  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [3a921cc37] :

	shared memory: Add support for bulk operations
	This patch adds the following functions:
	    * shm_malloc_bulk()
	    * shm_free_bulk()

	Their purpose is to minimize contention, in situations where the
	developer needs to perform lots of consecutive shared memory operations.
	In this case, their usage is as follows:

	shm_lock();
	shm_malloc_bulk();
	shm_malloc_bulk();
	...
	shm_free_bulk(...);
	shm_malloc_bulk();
	shm_free_bulk(...);
	...
	shm_unlock();

	Preprocessor: Proper fix for the issue behind f1fb2bd339
	The actual issue was related to the fact that most stream-oriented GNU
	tools (cat, sed, m4, etc.) work by managing a continuous flow of reads
	from the input source and writes to the output one, until the input file
	ending is reached.  This technique allows large amounts of data to be
	transformed without requiring any intermediary, equally large buffers.

	This patch creates the matching write/read looping logic into OpenSIPS,
	as it both feeds these preprocessing tools with the config file input,
	and consumes their output, unlocking them to process more bytes.

	Thanks to RÄƒzvan Crainea for spotting the problem!
