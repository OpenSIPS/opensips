2008-08-02 18:02:20  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at voice-system dot ro> 

	* [4535] :
	- fix PGRES_FATAL_ERROR bug in postgres driver
	- the result set was cleared in this case, but no error was> returned
	- reported from Andrew O. Zhukov, gnugk at telegroup dot com dot ua

	- further bug fixes for db_postgres_fetch_result and db_postgres_store_result
	- return also for all other abnormal query states an error, as the result set
	  is here set to zero too
	- this is probably a little bit to strict, but in the openser context this
	  types normally should not happen
	- as the old behaviour could lead to crashes if this gets eventually reported
	  from the driver, this is surely an improvement  :-)  
	  (most query user check only for return value < 0, and not for == 0)
	- in case for the PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY this could be not recognized as error
	  from upper layers at all, as this is defined as zero in the pg driver..

	- change log level for 'probably invalid queries' from WARN to ERR
	- as we stop execution and return a failure anyway, we should also
	  inform the user with the correct log level about this
	- move error message to default case

	Credits go to Henning Westerholt.



2008-08-02 18:00:47  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at voice-system dot ro> 

	* [4534] :

	Credits go to Dan Pascu and Henning Westerholt.


2008-08-02 17:17:05  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at voice-system dot ro> 

	* [4533] :
	various log message enhancements:
	  - remove prime_hash specific logging, instead log all hash_errors in the
	    actual routing function, now CRC32 errors are also logged
	  - change log level for doesn't completed rewrite_uri_recursor to INFO,
	    this is not necessarily an error, e.g. for blacklisted URIs. If an
	    error occured during this stage, its logged in previous steps of the
	    processing anyway.
	  - improve error messages for PV printing, instead of a generic message
	    give some hints about the problem

	Credits go to Henning Westerholt.
