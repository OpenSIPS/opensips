2014-02-05  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [26044bf] :

	digest+m_auth: Allow a domain in the digest username.
	Before this patch, a domain in the digest username was allowed:

	    Digest username="abc@domain", realm="domain"

	but only if the domain is equal to the realm. This was introduced in
	a92bf789 (Juha Heinanen, Mar. 29 2006).

	The SIP spec. doesn't mention any such restriction.

	This patch undoes that commit and makes sure the whole username is used
	when authenticating through `pv_www_authorize` and `pv_proxy_authorize`.
	That makes the following valid:

	    Digest username="abc@domain", realm="something different"

2013-10-18  Earl C. Ruby III  <eruby at knowledgematters dot net>
	* [403862a] :

	The latest Linux distros from OpenSUSE, Fedora, and other non-Debian based distros no longer add symlinks for libcurses.so -> libncurses.so. Trying to compile menuconfig with -lcurses will not work on these distros, so I changed -lcurses to -lncurses, since -lncurses will work on any modern Linux distro with the ncurses5 libraries installed.
	See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517756/whats-the-difference-between-lcurses-and-lncurses-when-compiling-c-using-ncur for more info.

	In DELAYED mode, flush vars & profile to DB at ACK time too - no timer tick between 200 OK and ACK was droping the update operation to DB. Please note that this "bug" had actually no implications, as dialog data is either used from memory cache, either from DB after a restart (and a shutdown flushes everything to DB).

	PUBLISH requests are now handled in the same order than received.

	* [bde8c0a] :

	Added a new module for performing voice transcoding using Sangoma D-series cards. (libsngtc_node dependency)

2013-08-02  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [70b6629] :

	Improved PUA DialogInfo.
	Several fixes here:
	  - Dialog callbacks are now correctly setup after a restart of
	    OpenSIPS. In other words, restarting OpenSIPS will not lead to ghost BLFs
	    anymore.
	  - Added an option allowing not to publish state change in case of reINVITE.
	  - Added an option allowing not to publish state change in trying state.
	    In other words, a PUBLISH will be sent only when OpenSIPS has received a
	    18x response type and not before.

2013-08-02  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [a95b7c0] :

2013-08-01  Vlad Paiu  <vladpaiu at opensips dot org>
	* [1aaef5e] :

	fixed compile errors introduced by previous commit (cherry picked from commit 2a6542a230dca3e0078a89db6aca2509d1cef41e)
	Conflicts:

		modules/sst/sst_handlers.c

2013-07-31  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [bc0a807] :

	Trigger exactly one callback per early state change.
	There are several reasons behind this change:
	1) Other callbacks are only triggered once for each state change.
	2) SNOM phones send several 180 Ringing messages in a row. That triggers
	several early dialog callbacks, which in turn trigger several PUBLISH
	and NOTIFY through the pua_dialoginfo module. This can potentially lead
	to problems.

2013-07-31  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [9366758] :

2013-07-31  Damien Sandras  <dsandras at beip dot be>
	* [679dcf2] :

	This patch implements several fixes to the SST module:
	 - Fixed things when only one peer supports Session-Timers.
	 - Fixed timer removal when both peers do not support Session-Timers and a
	   timer was fired at some point.
	 - Fixed Session-Timers usage in case of re-INVITES.
	 - Allow the proxy to negotiate a lower Session-Expires value if configured
	   to do so.
