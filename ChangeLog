	* [e32975f50] :

	    * invalid memory access on "presentity" ptr after send_publish_int()
	(cherry picked from commit 9957ff2d9acc4a2686495b5e2ea43cdc3bb7e3ed)


2017-07-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [4ba179df5] :

	Destroy the TCP conn even if the WS link has missing data.
	Perform full conn destroy (in the TCP network layer) even if the WS link doesn't have (very unlikely) the proto-specific data attached.
	(cherry picked from commit e08d54e6bc1a2550cd3ec6c7aec12f6a69b6377a)

2017-07-04  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [f2666cbc3] :

	Fix tracing race condition on SSL based connects
	When performing a connects (required by a write op) for a SSL enabled connection, the returning handshake make lead to a concurent read on the same connection.
	And the read op will try to dump the traced data aquired by the write (connect) op -> different processes, different memory chuncks
	To avoid such probles, the "connect" tracing will be flushed on write (a connect is always trigger by a write need) and the "accept" tracing will be flushed only on read (an accept is always followed by a read).
	(cherry picked from commit 059545765e34dc8016c278a3e4800a33929bd117)


2017-07-03  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [3fd772cf2] :

	Remove bogus auto conversion from SIP uri to TEL uri
	For ancient reasons, a SIP URI with user=phone was automatically converted to a TEL URI. Such conversion, automatically done, is dangerous - there is nothing in the RFC3261 stating something like this. Even more, the conversion is not complete - besides moving the username parameters to URI parameters, the domain is not stripped and the TEL not added.
	(cherry picked from commit 05ece794083f8328cbd5259cdb7b3aead8d9f943)

	* [b33c84392] :

	net/tcp: do not reset conn proc_no as a writer
	when releasing a conn as a writer, do not reset the process owner of the
	conn, otherwise a reader will have to re-take it back.
	(cherry picked from commit d5fca4482ab1746351157ee0353474a24b084f60)


2017-07-03  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0fd713369] :

	TCP engine: Fix a race condition related to con lifetime management
	Connections which received a read event concurrently with their
	expiration time could trigger an indefinitely long, CPU wasteful, rapid
	succession of back-forth passing of the connection object between TCP Main
	and a TCP worker process.

	The fix involves adding a TCP connection lifetime update in the TCP worker
	just after receiving the connection object from TCP Main (this is correct
	- there is some pending data, the connection is non-idle), before the
	expiration check is done.

	Thanks to Bogdan for helping with troubleshooting
	(cherry picked from commit 99181710c3f52b4ca97186623af0a7760191a276)


2017-07-03  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [1bf414226] :

	TCP engine: Fix ref counting bug in async writes
	TCP writes done by TCP workers were subject to an extra
	dereferencing operation, potentially leading to memory corruption
	due to SHM overwriting on freed tcp_connection structs.

	This patch eliminates the extra dereferening operation, while also
	taking care not to break the code for non-TCP worker writers, which
	will now have their passed connections dereferenced by TCP main.
	(cherry picked from commit 04e2d6e5f46b98c481b2e810ea0aa73c7be36b40)

	rtpproxy: allow multiple servers on same machine
	Before this fix, rtpproxy was accepting a single connection from a
	specific IP. This prevented multiple rtpproxy servers on the same
	machine (or behind the same NAT) to send timeout notifications

		This commit fixes 2 bugs:
		1) fixes not reading second part of a single TCP request
	because of bad parsed pointer update;
		2) fixes major bug that was causing packets to be processed
	infinite times by hep callback when one message + some part of a
	second message came in a chunk and in the second chunk it was the
	second part of the second message; the tcp request structure was
	not updated(complete was not set to 0 after first message was
	processed) causing the second message to be processed an infinte amount
	of times into the database;

	* [29a843213] :

	tls_mgm: use the domain name as an unique identifier for a TLS domain specificiation (both from DB and script)
	The 'domain' DB column is now mandatory and represents the domain name and identifier.
	When defining a domain through the script parameters 'server_domain' or 'client_domain'
	the syntax is now 'domain_name=IP:port' with the address part optional for client domains.
	Also, improve loading of default domains from DB and fix some issues: overriding script
	domains with DB domains at startup, crash when defining clients domains without address.

	* [4975a9fab] :

	tls_mgm: properly get the domain name and address from the corresponing DB columns
	Previously, the value of the domain column was only an id and the actual domain name
	was taken from the address column when it's value was not in the "ip:port" format.
	This was somewhat misleading and consequently the domain column now expects the
	domain name, and the address column an ip address and port.
	Also drop the not null constraint from the domain and address DB columns, as server
	domains only need and address and client domains can be either socket or name based.

	* [f3bbcb395] :

	[proto_wss] fix tls tracing without ws and possible memleak
		There were 2 cases when tls could have been traced without
	ws, but the hep message was not sent:
		1) when the certificate was not accepted by the connecting
	client causing an EOF after the TLS handshake; on this scenario
	the tls message was built but not traced, therefore a memory leak;
		2) when there was an error at the TLS level; the tracing
	was done only after the ws handshake took place therefore any tls
	error would have caused the message not to be traced;

2017-02-24  Andrey Vorobiev  <andrey.o.vorobiev at gmail dot com>
	* [1363a6204] :

	Set 'CURLOPT_FAILONERROR' option to '0' in rest_client module
	This is done in order to archive following goals:
	- suppress error log messages like 'curl_easy_perform: ...' when HTTP
	  server returns response with status code larger or equal to 400.
	- make 'rest_xxx' functions to have the same behaviour with different
	  Curl distributions. Now for different Curls these functions may
	  return different exit codes for the same HTTP response.

	There is an option in Curl named 'CURLOPT_FAILONERROR'. If it's set to
	'1' then if returned HTTP code is equal to or larger than 400 the HTTP
	request is considered as failed and 'curl_easy_perform' returns non
	'CURLE_OK' code. In vanilla (upstream) Curl this option is set to '0'
	(do not fail) but some patched Curl versions set this option to '1'
	(at least this is true for Debian Wheezy). As result we have a
	different behaviour for different Curl derivatives. So it seems to be
	better to enforce setting this option to '0' in order to have the same
	behaviour for different Curls.

	tcp: don't add conn in TCP main reactor after async write
	When getting back a TCP connection from a TCP worker after it wrote some
	async chunks, we should not add the connection in the reactor for read.
	The reason is that the connection might already be polled by a different
	process. If the poll triggers for read in the main reactor, the
	connection will be assigned to a new process - and we end up having a
	connection for read in two different processes reactor - this breaks
	connections list and results in double frees and invalid memory access.

	issue!

	Fix the traced src IP for replies.
	For the outgoing replies, do not use the src IP from the SIP msg (which points to the actual sender of the reply), but the OpenSIPS listening interface used for sending the reply out.

	Fixed entity index in the b2b callbacks.
	After some rework of the B2B API, the entities are counted starting from 0, while before they were form 1 - this was affecting the call center logic by mixing the caller versus callee parties of the call.

	Reported by Jonathan Hunter - many thanks also for testing !!

	drouting: Fix out-of-bound initialization
	Upon load/reload of drouting tables, if parse_destination_list() needs to
	increase destinations array size, it asks for a new array twice the size of
	the previous one.
	It memset() the newly allocated capacity, skipping memory that is to be filled
	with already learnt destinations, but using the array size instead of the
	remaining capacity.
	This patch fixes the size for this memset().

	Closes OpenSIPS/opensips#1039

	rest_client: Fix issues with libcurl parallel transfers
	We cannot use the "parallel transfers" feature of libcurl's multi interface
	because that would consume read events from some its file descriptors that
	had previously been added to the OpenSIPS reactor. This would sometimes lead
	to dangling descriptors in the reactor, as well as some OpenSIPS async routes
	which are not triggered.

	To work around this, we can still achieve the desired effect with a pool of
	multi handles each doing a single transfer, rather than using 1 multi handle
	doing multiple transfers.

	Thanks for reporting and troubleshooting to @arovetto and Agalya Ramachandran

	The body is completely rebuild based on the resulting list of body parts.
	Also the new code supports transparent transitions from no body to body, single part body to multi-part body or the other way around - with automatic update of the Content-Type and Content-Len headers, of course.

	* [d34e1fe59] :

	Fix broken ldap async engine
	   Previous ldap async engine implementation was broken. Now the
	module stores a pool of connections for each session which will
	be used for executing async queries and one separate connection
	that will be used for synchronous queries, in case the maximum number
	of open connections allowed(max_async_connections module parameter)
	is reached. The sync connection will also be used for synchronous
	queries from other functions.
	   The connection pool is stored per process, so each worker
	process will have its own pool and synchronous connection. For large
	numbers of asynchronous ldap calls per second, having a higher value
	for max_async_connections will result in better performance.

	This is needed as the DB exposes only the dialog_id, and the dialogs from DB cannot be correlated anymore with the MI commands. See #963

	Closes #963.

	clusterer: improve locking mechanism
	Replaced the lock that protected any access to the shm structures with a RW lock that protects the cluster list and corresponding node lists for insertions/deletions. Also, locks were added to the cluster info and node info structures that protect accesses to structure fields that may be changed when the RW lock is acquired for reading. In consequence potentially blocking operations, like message sending, can now be done without holding any lock(except the RW lock acquired for reading, which is safer because most of the time it won't block).

	[siptrace] allow other modules to trace messages
		A new api in siptrace module has been defined which allows
	tracing messages using any implemented trace protocol(currently
	only hep) in sip context(per message/transaction/dialog). This
	way tracing messages other than sip(log messages, rest, http)
	will be much easier to implement.
		Along with the new api, sip_trace function has been extended
	to accept another extra parameter which will specify the types of
	messages to be traced(by default only sip messages shall be traced).
	Modules that will implement the api have to register to siptrace
	module using an identifier which will be used by sip_trace function
	in order to identify the types of tracing that are enabled.
		Also initial trace api has been modified. After sending,
	the traced message won't be freed, leaving this posibility to the
	user.


2016-09-16  ionutrazvanionita  <ionutionita at opensips dot org>
	* [7660b8b4a] :

	Define generic tracing api and proto_hep implementation
		A new api has been defined in OpenSIPS core which
	provides functions for doing complex message tracing. Currently,
	the only module implementing this api is proto_hep which provides
	functions for HEP protocol.
		The new api provides functions for creating a tracing
	message, adding data to the message, sending the message and
	fetching destination structure info.
		The old api that was defined in proto_hep is still there
	but provides only the functionality used by sipcapture module,
	the callback registration function for received hep messages and
	the context position getter function which gives you the index
	where the hep context is being held. The rest of the functions
	are now being implemented by the generic api in core.
		What is more, siptrace module uses the core tracing api
	to send it's messages, having now more flexibility than ever.

	Fix potential starvation for the timer tasks.
	Even if the timer tasks have priority in the asyns reactor (for being handled), if all the worker processes are already busy in handling some SIP tasks which takes too long, may lead into a starvation of the timer tasks.
	For the moment we address this by creating a extra worker processes (similar to the SIP workers) which is dedicated to executing the timer tasks. Still, based on their availability and load, the SIP workers are able to consume timer tasks.

	In the next steps, this issue will be better addressed by implementing the concepts of "preferred jobs" and "capacity reservation" for the processes in the pool.

	Reworked the pinging mechanism so that it works more similar to the SIP session timers.
	Each call will get pinged on fixed intervals based after the 200OK is received, based

	* [e1fc73f98] :

	clusterer: complete module rework
		The clusterer module was completely reworked, starting with code refactoring and coding style improvements,
	in order to introduce better node availability detection and inter-cluster, failover message routing mechanisms.
		As there were no explicit probes at the clusterer module level, an active pinging mechanism was introduced
	which establishes the state of the connections of the current node with other nodes in the cluster. As such,
	when a node is unresponsive, it is not automatically considered down but only the direct 'link' with that node
	will be marked as failed. The current node will have to take into consideration the perspective of the other
	nodes in the cluster in respect to the state of the presumably failed node. This leads to the need of having
	an awareness of the entire topology in the cluster and when every other node has no link with a specific node,
	that node is reported as down.
		A link-state resembling protocol was implemented in order to learn the cluster topology and compute
	a routing 'table' used for sending bin messages between nodes.
		The clusterer module API was improved and its usage in the dialog, usrloc and ratelimit modules was adapted.

		[acc] introducing new extra/leg engine; module redesign
		Redesigning accounting module extra values engine raised
	    new problems which in the end were solved by redesigning the
	    whole accounting module.
	        First of all an accounting module context was created
	    which is available for the whole dialog lifetime. Having
	    this mechanism all values that were stored in avps or dialog
	    values are now being held in this context.
	        Using the new dialog callback that is triggered at shutdown,
	    extra and leg values are not abusing anymore of dialog values.
	    We store them there only when OpenSIPS closes by any means. This
	    made the code look a lot cleaner and the program faster by not
	    creating a dialog value for all INVITEs and restoring it for each
	    BYE.
	        Accounting module extra values new engine are the main purpose
	    of this commit. There are only two variables now, called
	    $acc_extra and $acc_leg. They are visible during the whole lifetime
	    of a dialog and provide a much cleaner and easier way to use this
	    powerful engine.
	        New parameters have been defined, extra_fields and leg_fields
	    through which one can define tags and log values. The tags are
	    used to reference $acc_extra and $acc_leg variables, whereas the
	    leg_fields will be the value that you will see in the logs.
	        As concerning the acc_leg variable, new legs can be created
	    using acc_new_leg() function. The value of the current leg can
	    be retrieved using $acc_current_leg. It's the script writer the
	    one who has to decide when is the moment to jump to a new leg.
	        Also from this commit diameter support from acc module has been
	    removed. Diameter didn't have any support and it wasn't
	    compatible with a diameter server.

	2) renamed DLG_SAVED into DLG_DB_SAVED
	3) added new DLGCB_DB_WRITE_VP callback that is triggered (while dialog is locked) just before flushing the vals/profiles into DB - this will allow other modules to quickly insert / update dlg vals just before the DB flush (to take advantage of the dlg persistency, while handling dynamic values). <- this is required by some ongoing work in ACC module.

	* [eb850a22f] :

	Fix advertised port and address per branch.
	Before the advertised_port/address are preserved only in the UAS part of the transaction - that means it is only one value and it is from the setting done in Request Route; whatever later setting done in Failure Route or Branch Route are not preserved at transaction level (even if they are used on the spot, for sending out the INVITE).
	So, when we have to build a local request (ACK or CANCEL), we do not remember which specific address/port were advertised for that particular UAC (branch).

	Fixes #917.

	* [86f776457] :

	Fix dialplan module when using db_text backend.
	The db_text makes no difference between NULL or "empty string" values in DB -> both are internally translated as NULL . The dialplan module, in a very abusive way, forces "not null" (in DB schema and in the code for data validation) even for columns that are optional (like subst_exp, repl_exp, timerec and attrs). Besides being bogus (if a column is not to be used, you have to set it to empty string rather than let it NULL), it makes impossible the usage of db_text with dialplan.
	This fix allows (DB and code) the mentioned DB columns to be also NULL.
	The change is backward compatible, it should not break any existing usage of the dialplan module.

	This module provides a set of avp_db_xxx functions which take pseudo

	flag has been set to username, domain or uri and specifed pseudo var
	did not contain username and host after parsing as SIP URI. This

2016-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [13970bb65] :

	TCP connection lookup: Add matching by transport
	The fact that all currently supported TCP-oriented protocols have different
	standard ports is not an excuse for not including the transport into the
	match condition (i.e. dest IP address + dest port + dest transport).

	This may very well prevent issues with messages being sent out over the
	wrong TCP connection in a number of scenarios where we employ TCP connection
	reusage over both plain TCP and TLS with a Proxy that specifies the same port
	in the topmost Via header when it establishes each of the two connections.


2016-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [715339fdd] :

	Revert "Accept TCP aliases by default"
	This reverts commit d62bc967b0d6784d2baced88b895da57f3f4ab9a.

	Firstly, TCP connection reusage (RFC 5923) should only be employed between
	TLS endpoints - only TLS allows the endpoints to authenticate each other
	during connection setup, preventing unauthorized connection hijacking.

	Secondly, aside from any security considerations, RFC 5923 must
	not be employed fanatically (Proxy-Proxy, Edge-UA, UA-Proxy) on any TCP
	connection (especially disregarding the ";alias" Via parameter!), but
	rather only between adjacent SIP entities who can both initiate a
	connection towards each other, and also support the RFC. In the real
	world, we're basically only talking about the Proxy-Proxy usage case, as
	any SIP UA scenario will most likely involve some form of NAT and a
	Proxy that cannot open connections backwards, towards the UA. In these
	cases, TCP connection reusage is _completely_ out of the question, as a
	single UA might end up receiving all calls of all users behind their
	public IP.

	Thanks to Jonas Borjesson for reporting the problem in the first place.

	Since commit 0873c14d1b81887823242a955217dcc854eb97c9 multiple
	network protocols can be used from one module. Proto_hep was changed
	to be able to use both tcp and udp in the same time. Moreover, there
	is no hep_version needed since we can receive HEPv1,v2 and v3 on any
	UDP interface. Since HEPv1 and v2 are not compatible with TCP, only
	HEPv3 will be support. For HEPv3, Sipcapture module can now relay
	packets from TCP to UDP or the reverse way.
	Siptrace module was also improved. Trace id's can now be defined with
	hep version and transport protocol, in order to be able to do multiple
	types of tracing with different HEP protocols and/or network transports.

	MI library: Add comments regarding a known issue
	Currently, MI arrays cannot contain objects with non-identical
	"name" attributes.

	This patch also quickfixes this issue in mi_list_all_profiles() by dropping
	the array idea altogether, in favour of a top-most object.

2016-04-18  ionutrazvanionita  <ionutionita at opensips dot org>
	* [c5700cce4] :

	[sipcapture][HOMERv5 incompatibility fix]generic capturing function
	      Added new function called report_capture which allows
	capturing hep packets in a generic format. It will be very
	effective for the third version of the hep protocol for capturing
	packets other than SIP. Also added a new table called rtcp_capture
	for storing everything capture with report capture.

	 [sipcapture][HOMERv5 incompatibility fix] HOMERv5 table rotation aware logic
	    * HOMVERv5 allows rotating tables by having a prefix which is
	    the fixed table name and a suffix which is a string containig
	    timestamps
	    * sip_capture now accepts table name as a parameter to sip_capture()
	    function
	    * both global table name and sip_capture table_name can have
	    a prefix(string) and a suffix(strftime format string);
	    * fixed bugs in async query building

	* [6852bd427] :

	[acc] fix double free issue
	Since callbacks were registered only at first, and aftewards only
	flags were changed there was no way to know if tm is to free the
	shmed flags from acc or dialog. For this a new flag was introduced
	to indicate whether the flags shall be removed either by dialog or
	tm.


2016-04-12  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>

	Even if we break the backward compatibility, makes more sens to explicitly set the db_url if you use the default partition
