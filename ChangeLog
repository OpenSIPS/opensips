        b2b_entities: add more entropy to from_tag generation

        The initial from-tag generation cosisted of an md5 hash over the From
        URI. Thus, if you would have generating client requests to the same
        entity (such as a media server), you would always get the same from-tag
        for all those requests.
        The current patch adds more entropy when generating the from_tag, such
        as the current timestamp (expressed in milliseconds) along with the
        process pid.

        mid_registrar: Fix occasional undesired De-REGISTER forwarding in mode 2

        If the timings were aligned in a specific way, the mid-registrar (in AoR
        throttling mode) would actually forward a De-REGISTER downstream even
        though it had at least 1+ healthy remaining contacts after having
        applied the De-REGISTER locally.  This would cause some degree of
        service loss, as the remaining UAs were registered on the mid-reg, but
        not on the backend.

        Fix pkg mem leak by var spec copying

        Commit fff57ac introduces a relativly useless memcpy (only for arm32 related). This copy of the var spec leaks the returned buffer containing the value of the spec, as per $dlg_val() - this implementation of the $dlg_val relys on the fact that the same spec will be received all the time, so a re-size-able buffer is attached to it.
        So, let's get rif of the culprit memcpy and replace it with a simpler cast, as per 7dc20e471bf89eef0e4586adae26744d38c38c01

        db_flatstore: Fix another race condition around MI 'flat_rotate'

        This race condition was related to invoking 'flat_rotate' 2+ times
        during the same second (UNIX timestamp).  Due to the way the
        timestamping logic was implemented, this could lead to files NOT being
        rotated at all on the 2nd 'flat_rotate', which falls in the same second.

        Although very rare, this race condition could lead to massive CDR loss,
        since all CDRs between 2nd and 3rd 'flat_rotate' commands have a great
        chance of being fully lost (unread and discarded).

        This commit simply adds R/W locking around the 'flat_rotate' MI command,

        * SIP worker checks the 'flat_rotate' stamp and proceeds to write CDR
        * 'flat_rotate' is ran (timestamp++)
        * external process scans & fully reads the rotated file (with deletion
           to follow later as well, but this is irrelevant)
        * SIP worker finally writes the CDR using flushed/vector'ed I/O
           (too late at this point, CDR is forever lost)

        dialog: Fix shtag restoration when loading from DB

        This fixes a hanging dialog profiles bug on the backup box (NULL shtag),
        in specific scenarios with dialogs + sharing tags, profiles with
        value and dialog + profile replication clusters (whole enchilada).

        In such cases, after restarting the backup box with active dialogs in
        the DB, it would end up with forever-hanging dialog profiles in memory,
        which would be continuously broadcasted to all cluster nodes,
        effectively adding (doubling) unnecessary counters to the overall limit.

        Credits to Vlad Pătrașcu for helping troubleshoot this bug!

        [tracer] avoid parsing the shm cloned SIP msg

        The TM TMCB_MSG_SENT_OUT callback may be called when doing a retransmission for a locally generated request. If for the original sending, a pkg malloc'ed sip_msg is passed to TMCB_MSG_SENT_OUT callback, for the retransmissions the shm cloned sip_msg is passed. As the 'tracer' callback (on TMCB_MSG_SENT_OUT) requires some FROM hdr parsing (to get the from tag), it should NOT parse directly on the shm cloned SIP msg as it will tain the shm sip_msg with pkg pointers -> better do a local parsing (not attached to the sip_msg) of the FROM HDR.
        This issue was leading to pkg leaking (of the parsed FROM hdr in the shm cloned sip_msg) or it a crash if using failure route from the local route.

        Note: this is specific to using tracer module from the local route.
        Closes  #2728

        While commit b5bcf046 fixed an issue with missing contexts during
        error_route, it was missed that the "parse_error" label does *not* free
        up the global context.

        The effects of this bug were mostly hidden, affecting only opensips.cfg
        scripts which employ the "error_route", causing a slow PKG memory leak,
        proportional to the amount of bad SIP received.  Moreover, if these
        scripts also use async(), they may occassionally run into a quick
        abort() in t_resume_async(), due to a context being already set (BUG).

        It seems the "if" condition at the start of t_resume_async() is
        actually reachable under the right circumstances and causes an
        immediate program crash.

        As an intermediate improvement until the source of the issue is found,
        try to simply overwrite the unexpected context, if one is found.  A
        small memory leak coupled with a CRITICAL log message is preferable to
        an instant, forced crash.

        This patch fixes a SIP message parsing error log which could lead to an

        OpenSIPS PKG memory allocator minimizes the severity of this overflow,

        clusterer: Always broadcast a packet after shtag activation

        Due to network outages, it is currently possible for both sharing tags
        of an Active/Backup pair to end up in ACTIVE state.  This patch makes it
        so a "cluster_shtag_set_active" MI command always broadcasts (forces)
        the ACTIVE state onto all neighbours, thus fixing the incorrect,
        post-outage state of the tags.

        Credits to @bogdan-iancu and @rvlad-patrascu for their contributions to

        tracer: fix possible double free during dialog tracing

        The initial transaction info free algorithm was to release the memory
        when there is no other tracing instance running. However, when engaging
        dialog tracing, a single dialog tracing instance is created, without a
        transaction one. But, when the BYE is received, it is traced using the
        transaction tracing, without an instance. Thus, the free function is
        called twice, once for dialog and once for transaction:
         * first call will find the dialog instance and release it, and release
           the info (since there are no remaining instances)
         * the second call, for the transaction instances releases would
           basically access invalid memory, which could lead to either double
           free, or even memory corruptions (in case fragment would had been
           repurposed)

    tls_wolfssl: fix differing TLS version for write duplicate struct

    When using a range of supported TLS versions, the WOLFSSL write duplicate
    structure uses the highest TLS version set for the context instead of the one
    actually negociated for the current session. This may lead to errors for TLS
    write or shutdown operations, for ciphers that are not supported in the
    TLS version used by the write dup structure.

	msrp_gateway: properly report MSRP leg setup failure
	Add an event triggered when the SIP session fails to set up on the
	MSRP side, when using the msg_to_msrp() function. This way, a message
	describing the failure can be generated on the MESSAGE side from an
	event route, for example.

	[disaptcher] added status/report support
	Each partition is a status/report (SR) identifier. It's status provides information DB data loading, like -2 (no data) , -1 (initial loading) , 0 (data available), 1 (reloading).
	The reports will log when a reload is done and what was the outcome of the reload (success or failure). If success, a more detailed report is generated with how many destinations were loaded / discarded.
	Also, each partition provides a separate identifier for reporting events about the change in state for the destinations

	In case the Redis raw query string arguments include whitespace (' ',

	double quotes ("), and OpenSIPS will pass the correct string to Redis.

	For example:
	    cache_raw_query("redis", "SET foo \"bar baz\"", "$avp(result)");
		or:
	    cache_raw_query("redis", "SET foo 'bar baz'", "$avp(result)");

	... are now possible and equivalent.  Both of these will set the
	"bar baz" value, without the quotes.

	of their own properties into a TCP connection profile, which may not be
	powerful enough to be represented as a separate column of the profile.
	Still, this feature allows developers to customize even those properties
	on a per-connection level, rather than global level.

	For now, only the "xxx_max_msg_chunks" settings of various TCP-based
	proto modules may be included in the new "attrs" URI params column of
	tcp_mgm, using a value of, e.g. "max_msg_chunks=10".  Int values only.

	The NET TCP layer provides the proto modules the possibility to return the connection (for more reading) BEFORE actually handling the current message.

	The proto_tcp exposes the new `tcp_parallel_handling` module parameter to control if read/handle for SIP messages should be done on TCP.


2022-04-19  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [6412c0ae1] :

	Added tcp_parallel_read_on_workers core parameter
	This option will allow a TCP conn to perform read operations from different processes, not only from one.
	So far, upon creation, a TCP conn was assigned to a TCP workers which was doing all the reading for that TCP conn. This may become a bootleneck.
	With tcp_parallel_read_on_workers, after a read is completed, the TCP conn is passed back to the TCP Main processes, which will perform a re-balancing for the next read operations, passing the TCP conn potentially to another worker.
	NOTE: at TCP conn level, the read ops are still performed in serial way, one at a time (even if from different processes)


2022-04-19  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [5a6399b13] :

	Improve the TCP conns balancing over the TCP workers
	Instead of balancing as number of conns per worker, balance based on the internla load of the TCP workers.
	At the end we want to avoid overloading some TCP workers, so to have a even load distribution. The number of TCP conns is irrelevant (as they may have different amount of traffic which may translate in different load values).

2022-04-18  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [b3a52022a] :

	Add the "tcp_mgm" module
	This module is entirely optional, and it offers a DB-based way of
	customizing the behavior of certain TCP connections depending on the
	protocol employed (e.g. BIN vs. TCP vs. MSRP, etc.), or specific
	combinations of remote/local IP addresses.

	When the module is not loaded, or when some connections fail to match
	any of the DB-defined TCP paths, the default TCP connection profile will
	be used instead, thus OpenSIPS remains fully backwards-compatible with
	the previous version.

	See 0aa8e9514e for more info on TCP connection profiles.

2022-04-13  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0aa8e9514] :

	TCP Engine: Add support for TCP connection profiles
	A TCP connection profile is a structure which currently holds 10
	individually customizable TCP connection settings:
	   - connect_timeout, con_lifetime, msg_read_timeout
	   - send_threshold, no_new_conn, alias_mode
	   - keepalive, keepcount, keepidle, keepinterval

	By default, the standard connection profile will simply contain values
	taken from the current TCP global parameters, for full
	backwards-compatibility.

	Building on top of this, modules may now override the connection profile
	matching function, allowing full customization of various TCP paths, as
	matched by the (protocol, remote_addr, local_addr) tuple.

	* [4e2fecbac] :

	compression module: mc_compact() - Added flag `n`
	Added flags param which accepts `n` for no compact headers.
	When specified, opensips will only remove headers not in the whitelist
	without using the compact form for From/To/CallID etc.
	`mc_compact("headers|whitlelist", "n")`

	The motive for this is, because some UAs do not understand the compact form
	I've also encountered weird bugs using the compact form with some UAs.

	This still allows for the option to whitelist headers and compact the message.

	Parser: Be more fuzzer friendly, using -DFUZZ_BUILD
	Since fuzzers typically use the system allocator in order to run ASan
	checks (i.e. -DPKG_MALLOC is not enabled), they will often run into
	false-positive crashes in the parse_hname2() function due to various
	read overflows which are harmless in production, thanks to the
	pre-allocated nature of the PKG memory chunk.

	This patch adds the HAVE() parser macro (tied to -DFUZZ_BUILD), which
	will be optimized (removed) in the public build (0 changes), while
	protecting against any read overflow when building with -DFUZZ_BUILD.

	clusterer: fix races when processing the sync end packet
	The BIN packet the marks the end of syncing might be processed before
	data from the last sync packet(s) has been completely consumed by modules.
	This would result in notifying modules and broadcasting the new
	capability state to other nodes in the cluster too soon. The dialog module
	for example might incorrectly drop dialogs before it has the chance to
	confirm them through syncing.
	This commit ensures that the post-sync actions are run after all sync
	chunks have been delivered to modules.

	The reports will log when a reload is done and what was the outcome of the reload (success or failure). If success, a more detailed report is generated with how many gateway/carrier/rules were loaded / discarded.


2022-02-08  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [21b84ccc7] :

	Added new status/report framework.
	The purpose of this framework is to allow Modules (or parts of the core) to register identifiers in order to publish their status (readiness) and reports (logs).
	There statuses/reports may be checked from scripts or listed via MI. This allow the script to check the readiness status of various components of OpenSIPS, or, an external entity may monitor (check, list, get events) of the status / readiness of OpenSIPS (or parts of it). Also reports (some important logs poduced by OpenSIPS/modules) may be listed via MI, in order to have some history of what happened inside OpenSIPS/modules.

	Available cfg commnds (core provided):
		sr_check_status( group, [identifier])

	Available MI commands (core providede):
		sr_get_status group identifier
		sr_list_status [group]
		sr_list_reports [group] [identifier]

	Available events (core provided):
		E_SR_STATUS_CHANGED ( group, identifier, new_status, new_details, old_status)

	The old "general" OpenSIPS status was ported to this new framework as group "core", identifier "main", publishing the core status (startup, running, terminating).

2021-12-21  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [bb1fcc27e] :

	$route variable: Add support for script "callback routes"
	The idea of "callback routes" was missed during the development of
	$route, with this feature having been first introduced in 3.1.

	Conceptually, a "callback route" is a contextless route that may be
	invoked in a nested fashion, during the processing of a SIP message in
	any of the routes.

	For example, on a SIP BYE:
	    1. route
		1.1 loose_route() (this triggers the "callback route",
		    e.g. see dlg_on_hangup())
		1.2 route "dlg_on_hangup" is run, contextless!
	    2. script processing continues! <--- here, $route output was broken

	This patch fixes the issue, by adding recursion detection into the
	run_top_route() function, such that the $route variable works as
	expected regardless of how many (nested) times it is called.

	Many thanks to Ben Newlin for catching this issue, as well as providing
	a detailed report!

	Fixes #2681

	[usrloc] fix contact matching on registrations handling
	instead of pron-to-error string matching, use the SIP wise matching when matching the registered contacts. The SIP URI matching is more complex, mainly when comes about the URI parameters - some important (user, transport, etc) params must be present in both URIs in order to match, other generic params may match even if the param is present in only one URI.

	Some devices may use during registration some proprietary params for the contact, but without sending the full list when re-registering or when deleting the contact - and this is perfectly ok from the perspective of the SIP RFC3261.

	Prior to the fix, in the above scenario, OpenSIPS will have failed to re-register or un-register the contact, leaking registrations.

	[core] make the per-process IPC sending non-blocking
	A process may get stuck (history showed us such real cases) and we do not want to have other processes getting blocked by trying to do an IPC to such procs (if they are stuck, they will not consume their IPC cmds, so the IPC sender will also block after some time, when the pipe's buffer is full).
	So, better make the write pipe non-blocking, discard the current IPC cmd and avoid escalating the blocking over other procs.

	phase before proto_bin is loaded so PROTO_BIN 5555 is defined, when the
	BIN port was missing from either BIN socket or above modparam node URLs,
	the following errors would be thrown:

	ERROR:clusterer:msg_send: send() to 10.0.0.210:0 for proto bin/7 failed

	... or:

	ERROR:clusterer:add_node_info: non-local socket <10.0.0.212> for ...

	The solution involves two changes:
	    1.  always define the PROTO_BIN 5555 port, so a missing node port
	        can be filled in as early as needed with the default 5555.  The
	        loading of proto_bin can later fill in the other proto fields.

	    2.  when a socket has an undefined port, use the .default_port of
	        the protocol when comparing it against an input node:port

	proto_bin: fix crash when parsed data is printed on error
	The module was trying to print the parsed data in case of an error,
	however it was using the `start` field of the tcp_conn. The problem is
	that the module does not use the `start` field, therefore when a request
	is not entirely read from the begining, it is not updated to point to
	the new structure. Therefore, when we're trying to print the buffer, it
	is pointing to an address on stack.
	The fix for this bug was to suppress the parsed printing, as it is
	binary anyway and it is the same value as the `buf`.

	If TLS session tickets were used for session resuming, the

	even if it did present a valid certificate in the initial TLS handshake.

	Even so, this fix can only guarantee that the peer can be verified when

	certificate initially. Otherwise, wolfssl does not provide a way of

	Memory allocators: Revert Q_MALLOC to 8-byte alignment
	Commit 1f55d05c2b actually upped Q_MALLOC's address alignment from
	8-bytes to 16-bytes.  While this isn't necessarily a bug (in fact,
	it makes OpenSIPS more crash-safe), it enables new scenarios where
	buffer overrun crashes would happen with F_MALLOC but not with Q_MALLOC.

	And since Q_MALLOC is the intended crash debugger, these scenarios
	must not be allowed, so we stick to 8-byte alignment.  If anyone needs
	16-byte aligned memory, they can just re-define ROUNDTO and re-compile.

	This patch fixes the support for configurable memory alignment, such
	that the ROUNDTO macro is now truly customizable, for any allocator.  As
	long as the ROUNDTO is a multiple of 2, the allocators will return
	memory aligned to any required multiple.

	The defaults are still the same, as follows:
	    * F_MALLOC: 8-byte aligned memory addresses
	    * HP_MALLOC: 8-byte aligned memory addresses
	    * Q_MALLOC: 16-byte aligned memory addresses (the default in libc!)

	Also extend the allocator testing suite with memory alignment tests.

	In this case, a new pinging transaction would be continuously started,

	Timeout for a dead SIP endpoint.

	This patch adds the "at_escape_str" modparam, which is only relevant for
	mid-registrar running in "mode == 2" (AoR throttling).  This setting
	gives developers more control over the mid-registrar's Contact headers
	in case the default sequence is problematic.

	This may fix issues where, for example, the "%40" string is un-escaped
	by the backend registrar, causing errors during DNS lookup of something
	resembling, e.g., "alice@1.1.1.1@2.2.2.2".
	                         ^-------------^

	[presence] Fix inconsistent handling of optional "event_id" column
	If no value, the event_id could end up with a NULL or "" value. This was failing the later update query (no match on the event_id value), resulting in broken subscription status after a re-subscribe.

	* [fb9a37776] :

	F_MALLOC: Always perform an O(1) defragmentation on free()
	Changes:
	    * remove the "memory space" runtime computation, as well as the 95%
		defragmentation "start threshold" (better performance!)
	    * change the defragmentation heuristic from O(N) to O(1).  This way,
	        we avoid any performance issues caused by _too much_
		defragmentation

	The main idea is to get rid of the dreaded "not enough shared memory,
	attempting defragmentation..." state, where SHM performance goes down
	dramatically, to the point where SIP traffic processing may stall.

	When the "M<matching-mode>" save() flag is not used, the registrars
	should not default to forcing the Contact-only matching mode (0), rather
	they should use the None mode (-1), and let usrloc use its own default
	setting.

	Update MySQL DB migration scripts for "3.1 to 3.2"
	New tables in 3.1, now added to the migration procedure:
	    * jwt_profiles
	    * jwt_secrets
	    * qr_profiles
	    * rc_clients
	    * rc_vendors
	    * rc_ratesheets
	    * rc_demo_ratesheet

	Changed tables in 3.2 (their columns no longer match 1:1, however the
	migration procedure still migrates their data):
	    * b2b_logic
	    * pua
	    * registrant
	    * subscriber

	* [1c5e895db] :

	Fix memory corruption in usrloc/ul_evi
	Problem spotted by Liviu Chircu and bisected to fe28d3ea9.

	Fixes #2529.


2021-05-26  Walter Doekes  <walter+github at wjd dot nu>
	* [87f241651] :

	Change CON_SET_CURR_PS pattern to always call it _directly_ before db call
	Because CON_SET_CURR_PS is always followed by an immediate call to
	CON_RESET_CURR_PS inside the DB function, it makes sense to call
	CON_SET_CURR_PS just before the DB call.

	Otherwise you could get this:

	   CON_SET_CURR_PS(...);

	   for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	       // first insert uses prepared statement
	       db.insert(...);
	       // but second time in the loop, we use "plain" text queries
	   }

	The updated pattern would look like this:

	   for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	       // the ps handle is always reset, so we reinit it every time
	       CON_SET_CURR_PS(...);
	       db.insert(...);
	   }

	Note that we don't need any explicit CON_RESET_CURR_PS() at odd points
	anymore (like was added in 57caa6c03). A SET is immediately followed by
	an implicit RESET.
