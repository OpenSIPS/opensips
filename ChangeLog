2011-06-30 20:40:22  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8107] :

	- TM may create its own timer process 
	"Under heavy load, the presence cleanup routes and the register cleanup routines can take several minutes each. During this time, the tm timers, and in particular the retransmission timers don't run. Given that the first retransmisssion timer is 0.5sec, even very small delays caused by the cleanup routines can kill the retransmissions. This patch "fixes" this by allowing a dedicated timer process for tm."

	Based on patch #3028765, contributed by Kennard White, heavly modified.


2011-06-30 20:26:18  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8106] :

2011-06-30 19:25:18  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [8105] :

	- fixed race between UPDATE and DELETE when using DB_ONLY mode (one processe can update a record, while timer proc tries to delete it). The result is loosing contacts from database. The fix is to use REPLACE (if available on DB level) instead of UPDATE (as records may be missing).
	  Based on an original idea from patch #2969454; Credits go to Stanislaw Pitucha 

	- fixed bug in MI interface when using wrong callid and cseq for searching contacts via MI commands.

	- fixed race condition - on timeout, first CANCEL first the branch and only then generate a new branch (serial forking on timeout).

	fix_contact does not escape properly an IPv6 address. This patch adds support for this.

	(This patch is needed for example to support a broken client that sends its private IPv4 address as contact, even though a valid global IPv6 address could be provided -- qutecom in my test scenario.)

	The fix is simply to detect IPv6 and use brackets around the IP address.

	Insert buffering introduced to OpenSIPS DB core
	Instead of flushing inserts row by row to DB, wait for query_buffer_size rows to pile up, and only then flush to DB

2010-12-17 10:38:38  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [7561] :

	- fixed handling of WANT_READ / WANT_WRITE events in TLS code. Description:
	  
	tls_blocking_write() polls for both POLLOUT and POLLIN at the same time. Normally, socket is ready for write all the time. It causes poll() at line 765 returned immediately.

	When using t_relay("tls:xxx") in script, I always get "too many retries with no operation" error message because poll() function returns immediately.

	I read the OpenSSL doc http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_connect.html and http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_get_error.html#item_SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ.
	When SSL_connect(), SSL_read(), or SSL_write() return SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ, tls_blocking_write() should poll for POLLIN only. And when they return SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE, tls_blocking_write() should poll for POLLOUT only.

	I think this bug also makes CPU usage to be 100% while looping.


	Credits for the fix go to Worawit Wang.

	Closes Bug report #3061895

2010-08-01 23:39:36  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [7084] :

	When rewriting the SDP of an ACK rtpproxy_answer() retrieves the wrong port from rtpproxy.

	This is reproducible by handling SDP offered in a 200 Ok response with rtpproxy_offer() and then processing the answering SDP in an ACK with rtpproxy_answer() - the result is that the same port gets written into the ACK's SDP as was written into the Ok's SDP. In short, the 200 Ok is being handled correctly when it contain an SDP offer since the to/from tag are swapped inside force_rtp_proxy() before getting passed along to rtpproxy. The swap is critical as it provides consistent results when processing SDP offered in INVITE requests and Ok responses during re-invites within the same dialog. But the complimentary swapping is not being done for SDP answers contained in ACKs.

	Closes patch 3019749
	Credits go to John Riordan

	* [7065] :

	Another fix, not final yet


2010-07-29 19:43:01  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [7063] :

	For accounting purposes, I needed to know which gateway a request was sent to. Since there was already an AVP inside the drouting module that stored this information, I just modified the code to allow this AVP to be accessed from inside the routing scripts. There is a new module parameter called id_avp to configure where it will be stored.

	The AVP will only contain a value between the time do_routing/next_gw is called and the request is sent to the next hop.

	Closes patch 3034371

2010-04-26 10:10:51  Maxim Sobolev <sobomax at sippysoft dot com> 
	* [6819] :

	Support auto-bridging feature found in the latest RTPproxy (trunk code at the
	moment, 1.3 when released). Feature is still considered work in progress, so
	use with caution. Should be a no-op for the users of the stable RTPproxy version
	(1.2 and less).



2010-04-26 10:00:34  Maxim Sobolev <sobomax at sippysoft dot com> 
	* [6818] :

	This is a mechanism to register per-message callback handlers
	to be called at certain points of the message lifecycle.

	Apart from the sip_msg structure, each handler is passed a
	pointer to a handler type-specific structure from the core
	and pointer to an opaque structure allocated by the module.

	The following callback types are supported:

	 REQ_PRE_FORWARD - called before the request is getting reassembled
	 for delively. Can be used to apply some last-minute transformations.
	 Depending on the script structure this handler may not be called for
	 particular message at all or can be called multiple times. Core will
 pass "struct proxy *" to the handler describing destination for the
	 current request.

	 MSG_DESTROY - called when the message is being freed. Can be used to
	 release any module-specific per-message resources, including any
	 dynamic structures passed to the msg_callback_add(). Once
	 registered, this handler is guranteed to be invoked exactly once for
	 each message.

	To avoid memory leaks, code that allocates dynamic structures for use
	in the callback handlers should always register MSG_DESTROY handler
	and free all memory in there.

	Right now it's pretty much a no-op, until there are modules that
	use this new interface. Such change for the nathelper is coming.

2010-02-03 12:34:33  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [6561] :

	History behind this change (WARN -> INFO):
	The messages you are seeing means that the TCP MANAGER process sees that all the TCP WORKER processes are already processing other messages, so  no one is free (idle), so , it will queue the current active connection to one of the TCP WORKERs...
	There is nothing wrong with this, it is the normal way it works - of course, if you have too few TCP workers, the probability to have queuing is higher.

	In UDP the queueing is not visible at application level as it is done by the kernel in the receive buffer that is assigned to the socket.

	In TCP the queueing is visible as there is a single TCP MANAGER process managing the connections (detecting the reads, connects, etc) which is quite fast (not doing any processing) -> the queueing is moved between the TCP MANAGER and TCP WORKERS.

	Also, to be sure you got it right, there is no relation between the TCP WORKER and a connection. A TCP WORKER process is just reading and processing a SIP message at a certain time. Next SIP message from the same connection may end up in a different TCP WORKER proc.

	* [6431] :

	Use generic name of python interpreter and put a note about which
	versions are supported.



2009-12-14 11:20:19  Maxim Sobolev <sobomax at sippysoft dot com> 
	* [6430] :

	Add python module, which allows extending opensips.cfg using full-fleged
	Python code. For now only few basic methods are supported and it's also
	possible to call functions in other modules from the python code.

	The architecture of the Python environment follows the OpenSIPS paradigm:
	there are as many independent environments as there are OpenSIPS working
	processes. At the same time, each Python environment instance, which usually
	only gets control when the message is received, can create its own thread
	of execution and those threads can potentially co-operate using pipes,
	shared memory, database or some other IPC mechanism to provide
	transaction-stateful or even dialog-stateful features. The module itself
	is GIL-safe.

	The code should be considered experimental and work-in-progress, so use
	on your own risk.

	TODO: documentation, access to AVPs, interface to shared memory.

	Patches, documentation and suggestions are welcome.

2009-12-12 15:55:11  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [6427] :

	In case opensips force the use of sst, it add a Session-Expire with
	interval equal to max(OpenSIPS minSE, UAS minSE).
	This does not allow to set a minSE of 90s (the minimum allowed) but start
	with a different interval (say 300s).

	This patch add a sst_interval parameter with a default value of 0 (to stick
	to the current behavior).
	The Session-Expire interval is set to the max value of (OpenSIPS minSE, UAS
	minSE, sst_interval).

	Closes patch #2887955
