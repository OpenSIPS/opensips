        the buffer - if that's the case, we should repoint all the old values to
        the new location, otherwise they will point to an invalid value.

        Many thanks to Rob Moore and Steven Ayre from Dubber for reporting and
        helping us testing and troubleshooting this corner case.

        The computation perform by the ratelimit module is very time sensitive - any deviation of the interval between the runs of the timer handler may lead to false positive detection of CPS thresholds.
        So, let's move the timer handler from regular timer (1s sensitivity) to utimer (100ms sensitivity) -> 10 times more accurate.

        F_MALLOC: Optimize the free() operation

        Commit bdaaf60b2c introduced a side-effect of gradually moving the
        fragment "action" towards the exponential, non-optimized hash table
        buckets (i.e. buckets 2049 ... 2100).  Here, the fragments were inserted
        in a sorted fashion, with the sorted-insert algorithm costing a O(N)
        iteration on each free operation instead of a simple O(1).

        Consequently, the user experience of this effect is that "dr_reload"
        operations were stalling for 12 minutes (coming up from 24 seconds!),
        when working with large rule sets (millions of rules).  Interestingly
        enough, the stalling was not due to the caching phase -- malloc() --
        rather due to the cleanup phase, when clearing the old rules -- free()!

        To address this issue:

        * we drop the sorted insertion completely for buckets 2049 ... 2100, and
            simply do a list prepend operation: O(1), as with the others
        * we make all allocation requests from these buckets return the next
           bucket (!!), thus guarantee'ing our requested fragment.  Examples:

              malloc(18K) -> now you always get a 32K+ frag, but instantly!
              malloc(37K) -> now you always get a 64K+ frag, but instantly!
        * this does not make F_MALLOC more wasteful, since the extra frag
          space gets split anyway into a new fragment, with the two eventually
          coalescing together again thanks to commit bdaaf60b2c

        Loading the cachedb_mongodb module alongside the tls_openssl module, but

        mongoc library openssl initialization issues (initially fixed in commit
        298bf6b). Commit 69ed4f7 split all the openssl related code from the tls_mgm
        module into a new tls_openssl module but some openssl initialization bypasses
        from the cachedb_mongodb module were left to depend on loading the tls_mgm

        Migrate from index to references when pointing to a script route

        The idx are hard to work with in the context of script reload, as they cannot be upated or checked (if still valid).
        So, instead of pointing to the route by its idx, use an intermediary structure that holds: name of the route, the idx of the route, the version of the script.

        Now, such intermediary structs (or route refs) may operate in 2 ways:
        * they are per process, in pkg; all such refs are linked in a single list and automatically updated (their idx) upon reload.
        * they are shared (like attached to data structs in shm), in shm; if so, before using it, the version is checked, and if old, the idx is updated on spot.

        Also, this commit fixes an issue where MI processes (mostly FIFO and
        HTTPD) were doing 2X the amount of communication with each RTPEngine on
        startup, due to the initialization being called twice in these:  once in
        child_init(), then in mi_child_init() by calling child_init() again :-)

        [call_center] fix overflowing the per-agent array of skills

        As the array of skills is pre-allocated inside the agent struct, be sure you do not overflow it when populating the agent's skills (from DB).
        Also, the logstate/logged_in value for an agent is read from DB or MI and it must be forced to 0/1 values, as it is later used as index. Yet another overflow fixed here.

        F_MALLOC: Add LHS coalescing on free() operations

        This is a continuation/rework of commit fb9a3777, which intended to
        address the de-fragmentation issues where performance would drop.
        Unfortunately, there were still memory allocation / releasing patterns
        which still lead to heavy fragmentation.  For example, an MI "dlg_list"
        command, which allocates fragments from Left -> Right as the dialog list
        is walked:

            Chunk-1  Chunk-2  Chunk-3 ... Chunk-N

        After building the MI output, the chunks were also freed Left -> Right.
        Due to the former allocator logic of RHS-only coalescing, the coalescing
        would never happen!  In some cases, this could lead to fragmentation of
        an indefinite amount of memory, given enough time (e.g., even 8 GB PKG).

        This patch adds LHS coalescing to F_MALLOC, such that when "Chunk-2" is
        freed, in the above example, the allocator tries to merge it with both
        "Chunk-1" and "Chunk-3" before exiting the free() function (depending on
        the state of chunks 1 and 3, this could mean 0, 1 or 2 coalescings).

        This F_MALLOC patch was stress-tested using the mem/test/ testing suite.

        Many thanks to @fedkis and @ankogan for helping troubleshoot the issue
        and also test the current version of this patch!

        Before OpenSIPS 3.2, the "secret" modparam supported random-length
        strings, to be hashed into an MD5 computation when generating the nonce.

        Starting with 3.2 and the new AES-CBC based nonce generation algorithm,
        the "secret" has been restricted to 32-bytes only, however OpenSIPS
        would assert() -> abort() on startup without displaying any helper error
        if the user supplied a different-length secret.

        event_route: fix crash when raising with no params

        When raising an event using `raise_event` with AVP values that are not
        correctly populated, it triggers a corner case in the event_route
        module: the module "serializes" the parameters just after the event,
        hence, if there is no expanded parameter, the first parameter ends up
        pointing to a bogus value, resulting in a crash.

        This commit fixes this corner case by treating  it (0 expanded
        parameters) just as if there no parameters passed at all.

        Many thanks to David Escartin from Sonoc for the help in troubleshooting
        this issue!

        As a TCP worker has 2 comm channels (one TCP worker specific and one worker generic) to TCP Main, be sure we have a consistent communication (over the 2 channels) between the TCP worker and TCP main.
        The actual fixed race: the TCP workers creates a new TCP conn (and sends this event as TCP worker to Main) and when trying to write to the conn it fails (and sends back a bad-conn event to Main, but as generic worker) - the 2 events are delivered via different comm channels, so their order may be lost, reasulting to bogus behavior

        Fix what seems to be a typo, calling sockaddru_len() on unitialized
        local structure is likely to produce bogus result causing getsockname()
        to fail silently and produce no useable address. This error has
        been masked on Linux, since Linux has no sa_len structure and the
        sockaddru_len() in that case defaults to sizeof(struct sockaddr_in)
        unless local_su happens to have s.sa_family==AF_INET6. This however
        means that IPv6 has been somewhat broken for TCP & TLS.

        tls_wolfssl: fix regression in commit 77f5f5a

        The wolfSSL_CTX_load_verify_locations_ex() function would still return
        an error when no valid CA certificate was found in the directory.
        Since before commit 77f5f5a, opensips startup would not fail when
        wolfSSL_CTX_load_verify_locations_ex() would return an error, the change
        in the above commit would constitute a regression for cases where no valid
        certificate is found in the directory.

        route params: Fix regression in 8761ce6d20

        The patch assumed that variables with PV_VAL_INT|PV_TYPE_INT have
        symmetric values (e.g. 5 and "5"), whereas this is not always the case
        (e.g. 1 and "INVITE", returned by $rm) and would proceed to duplicate
        the output buffer as a int2str() buffer, for safety purposes.

        The fix is to avoid the duplication completely (i.e. do not overwrite
        "INVITE" with "1"), thanks to the route params array string buffers
        having a sufficiently large lifetime in order to be safely returned to
        the calling code asking for the route parameter.

        The gettimeofday(2) function actually returns the .usec as a *relative*

        incorrect to subtract the @begin.tv_usec field from the @end.tv_usec@
        field, as this can lead to a negative number!

        uac: Add basic detection for multiple uac_replace_xxx() calls

        This patch adds a lightweight detection of multiple calls to
        uac_replace_from() or uac_replace_to() during the processing of a SIP
        request, using an int bitmask stored in the current SIP message context.
        Returning an error helps avoid producing a bad SIP From/To header, with
        doubled URIs due to doubled lumps, etc.

        Still, to compromise between safety and performance, the case where
        multiple uac_replace_xxx() get called during a failure_route is not
        detected, as this would require extra TMCB_ON_FAILURE callback, which is
        a bit of overkill just for the sake of scripting QoL...

        The release_urecord() function may actually delete the AoR on the spot,

        causing an invalid SHM memory read when calling iterator_next(),

        [tm] fixed double freeing on t_uac() callback param

        If the t_uac() fails after the transaction was created (like it fails while trying to send the buffer out on the network), a double free will be done on the eventual callback func params: (1) via the released function attached to the completion callback (this will be automatically done upon free_cell() and (2) when t_uac() returns failure to the upper layer.

        The fix is NOT to free the param if the t_uac() returns error. So even if the transaction was created, remove the release function on the callback func params, to prevent the free (1), and to allow the upper layer to do its own cleanup.

        Fix pkg mem leak by var spec copying

        Commit fff57ac introduces a relativly useless memcpy (only for arm32 related). This copy of the var spec leaks the returned buffer containing the value of the spec, as per $dlg_val() - this implementation of the $dlg_val relys on the fact that the same spec will be received all the time, so a re-size-able buffer is attached to it.
        So, let's get rif of the culprit memcpy and replace it with a simpler cast, as per 7dc20e471bf89eef0e4586adae26744d38c38c01

        db_flatstore: Fix another race condition around MI 'flat_rotate'

        This race condition was related to invoking 'flat_rotate' 2+ times
        during the same second (UNIX timestamp).  Due to the way the
        timestamping logic was implemented, this could lead to files NOT being
        rotated at all on the 2nd 'flat_rotate', which falls in the same second.

        Although very rare, this race condition could lead to massive CDR loss,
        since all CDRs between 2nd and 3rd 'flat_rotate' commands have a great
        chance of being fully lost (unread and discarded).

        This commit simply adds R/W locking around the 'flat_rotate' MI command,
        and all the SIP worker processes.  The race condition was as follows:

        * SIP worker checks the 'flat_rotate' stamp and proceeds to write CDR
        * 'flat_rotate' is ran (timestamp++)
        * external process scans & fully reads the rotated file (with deletion
           to follow later as well, but this is irrelevant)
        * SIP worker finally writes the CDR using flushed/vector'ed I/O
           (too late at this point, CDR is forever lost)

        This fixes a hanging dialog profiles bug on the backup box (NULL shtag),

        value and dialog + profile replication clusters (whole enchilada).

        In such cases, after restarting the backup box with active dialogs in
        the DB, it would end up with forever-hanging dialog profiles in memory,
        which would be continuously broadcasted to all cluster nodes,
        effectively adding (doubling) unnecessary counters to the overall limit.

        [tracer] avoid parsing the shm cloned SIP msg

        The TM TMCB_MSG_SENT_OUT callback may be called when doing a retransmission for a locally generated request. If for the original sending, a pkg malloc'ed sip_msg is passed to TMCB_MSG_SENT_OUT callback, for the retransmissions the shm cloned sip_msg is passed. As the 'tracer' callback (on TMCB_MSG_SENT_OUT) requires some FROM hdr parsing (to get the from tag), it should NOT parse directly on the shm cloned SIP msg as it will tain the shm sip_msg with pkg pointers -> better do a local parsing (not attached to the sip_msg) of the FROM HDR.
        This issue was leading to pkg leaking (of the parsed FROM hdr in the shm cloned sip_msg) or it a crash if using failure route from the local route.

        Note: this is specific to using tracer module from the local route.

        Fix global msg context leakage in error_route

        While commit b5bcf046 fixed an issue with missing contexts during
        error_route, it was missed that the "parse_error" label does *not* free
        up the global context.

        The effects of this bug were mostly hidden, affecting only opensips.cfg
        scripts which employ the "error_route", causing a slow PKG memory leak,
        proportional to the amount of bad SIP received.  Moreover, if these
        scripts also use async(), they may occassionally run into a quick
        abort() in t_resume_async(), due to a context being already set (BUG).

        * [7167bec5b] :

        async(): Attempt to recover from abort() state

        It seems the "if" condition at the start of t_resume_async() is
        actually reachable under the right circumstances and causes an
        immediate program crash.

        As an intermediate improvement until the source of the issue is found,
        try to simply overwrite the unexpected context, if one is found.  A
        small memory leak coupled with a CRITICAL log message is preferable to
        an instant, forced crash.

        This patch fixes a SIP message parsing error log which could lead to an

        OpenSIPS PKG memory allocator minimizes the severity of this overflow,

        rtpproxy: Do not reconnect to all sets at once (do it on-demand)

        Following an MI reload, each OpenSIPS worker would reconnect to all
        rtpproxies in all rtpproxy sets on the first offer/answer/engage
        function call.  This behavior scales poorly with the number of rtpproxy
        sets, especially if multiple sets are used only for different public IP
        address advertising purposes, while reusing the rtpproxy comms socket.

        This commit adds on-demand reconnects, such that only the desired set is
        reconnected in a SIP worker following the reload.  This allows the sets
        in the "rtpproxy_sockets" table to scale freely, without introducing
        excessive latencies on the first slew of calls following a reload
        operation.

        Possible further optimization: do the reconnect at node level!

        tracer: fix possible double free during dialog tracing

        The initial transaction info free algorithm was to release the memory
        when there is no other tracing instance running. However, when engaging
        dialog tracing, a single dialog tracing instance is created, without a
        transaction one. But, when the BYE is received, it is traced using the
        transaction tracing, without an instance. Thus, the free function is
        called twice, once for dialog and once for transaction:
         * first call will find the dialog instance and release it, and release
           the info (since there are no remaining instances)
         * the second call, for the transaction instances releases would
           basically access invalid memory, which could lead to either double
           free, or even memory corruptions (in case fragment would had been
           repurposed)

        When using a range of supported TLS versions, the WOLFSSL write duplicate
        structure uses the highest TLS version set for the context instead of the one
        actually negociated for the current session. This may lead to errors for TLS
        write or shutdown operations, for ciphers that are not supported in the
        TLS version used by the write dup structure.

        aaa_diameter: Rework exposing command results to script

        The initially exported value of Result-Code AVP integer value was not
        ideal, as many Diameter exchanges are actual queries, with much more
        rich data to be returned than just an integer code.

        This commit replaces the "reply_code_pv" parameter of dm_send_request()
        with "rpl_avps_pv", containing a JSON Array with all AVPs from the
        Diameter Answer, as well as their values.

        msrp_gateway: properly report MSRP leg setup failure

        Add an event triggered when the SIP session fails to set up on the
        MSRP side, when using the msg_to_msrp() function. This way, a message
        describing the failure can be generated on the MESSAGE side from an
        event route, for example.

        msrp_gateway: properly clean up lingering sessions

        Add a session timeout after which to end a session if no message has
        been received from either side for that session. Also, add a specific
        timeout that is triggered by no activity on the MESSAGE side.

        Also add the ability to list and end sessions from the outside, via MI
        functions.
