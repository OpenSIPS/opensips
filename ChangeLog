        When restoring (from cache) a hostend structure, be sure you end the "aliases" and "addresses" arrays with a NULL element.
        Without that NULL terminator, when doing DNS-based failover on a cached hostend, OpenSIPS will use garbage IPs from the addresses array.

        usrloc HA: Improve management for replicated "labels"

        This patch aims to fix the occasional "differring rlabels"
        debugging error messages which may occur after a restart in usrloc HA
        scenarios, especially if the active SIP box is restarted while
        processing REGISTER requests in parallel.

        Since both record and contact labels are dynamic, per-instance and lost
        on restart, conflicts are to be expected.  The idea behind the fix is to
        simply adapt the replicated contact_id to the local instance, thus
        preferring the local labels to the remote labels whenever detecting
        conflict.

        clusterer: Fix links going down during sync; Optimize pinging

        This patch makes it so *any* succesfully sent BIN packet is also
        considered a Ping (for sender) and Pong (for receiver).  This helps
        improve the stability of the inter-node links, which will no longer go
        down during a lengthy sync operation (e.g. 50K+ registered phones, which
        take a few seconds to sync, and which would also significantly delay any
        Ping/Pong packets happening to be queued up on that same TCP stream).

        Moreover, thanks to the "last ping" timestamp updates during regular
        BIN replication mentioned above, the clusterer pinging timer will now
        only generate Ping packets during idle times (no BIN traffic produced).

        The default of 32 chunks was too low, considering that BIN TCP conns are
        very low in count (often a handful of nodes!), while also transporting
        large volums of data within short periods of time (e.g. dialog/usrloc
        syncs), so async data buffering may often occur.

        clusterer: Fix sync edge-case causing SHM accumulation

        This patch fixes a specific sync sequence leading to indefinite
        accumulation of BIN packets and SHM exhaustion, as follows:

        1) Sync Receiver node times out the sync in sync_check_timer()
            (default timeout is 5s, by no means difficult to achieve)
        2) Sync Donor continues to send SYNC packets
            (on Receiver side, cap state is updated: PROGRESSING)
        3) ! Sync Donor node loses link-state mid-sync, due to the pings being
            on the same TCP connection (and delayed, way in the back)
        4) Sync Donor fails & drops remaining SYNC + SYNC-END packets, as link
            is down.  Due to this, the handle_sync_end(!is_timeout) procedure
            is never ran on the Receiver, so the PROGRESSING flag is never
            removed -> indefinite SHM buffering / memory leak

        Thanks to Răzvan Crainea for helping with code & troubleshooting here!

        dialog: accurate match of outgoing legs

        The initial code assumes that for each transaction branch, we serially
        create a dialog leg - therefore, when a reply is received for a specific
        branch, we match the leg based on its index.
        This logic breaks when having a branch that has no outgoing leg/message
        (i.e. when push notification is used), because the dialog legs id gets
        offsetted by the number of "blind" branches, thus we are no longer able
        to properly match the reply with the leg.
        This fix makes sure that when creating a let, it has the same index as
        the transaction's branch id, hence the reply is properly matched.

        clusterer: Prevent startup delays from causing aborted syncs

        This patch makes it so the 'seed_fallback_interval' modparam
        time-counting is done in a way that *ignores* any random startup delays
        (e.g. mod init stuff which may take time such as loading drouting,
        dispatcher, rtpproxy, etc.).

        Previously, the effect of this issue was that some modules (e.g. usrloc)
        would randomly *not* sync data on startup, depending if the startup
        delay happened to be lesser or greater than the 'seed_fallback_interval'.

        characters, which breaks the value when storing. Instead, store them as
        a hex-string.

        tm: fix bogus contact built without domain

        When fixing headers for fake messages (`fix_fake_req_headers` func), the
        function was looking for lumps that were removing the contact, because
        it would assume they will be the same that would add a new one (i.e.
        `fix_nated_contact`). However, the `toppology_hiding("U")` function,
        would create a del lump, but then adding 3 lumps over it. This would
        make the fixing bogusly learning the contact as "sip:$user" instead of
        hole URI.
        The fix for this was to make sure that there is only one ADD lump,
        otherwise it would point to a shorter (broken) URI.

        Credits go to David Trihy from Genesys for reporting and helping us
        troubleshoot.

        While walking the list and collecting expired subscriptions, it is
        incorrect to temporarily release, then re-acquire the lock and still
        make use of the @s or @prev_s pointers afterwards, as the list may have

        them in a separate iteration.

        sql_cacher: remove test key from cache

        Since this key is stored in a non-base64 format, when the hash is being
        iterated, this value breaks the convesion - and when trying to
        `base64_decode("cdb_test_val")`, this results in a larger value than the
        expected integer, resulting in a stack crash.

        Removing the key from the hash fixes this crash, as all keys remain are
        properly base64 encoded. Moreover, if the key is not properly encoded,
        we should make sure that its decode does not overwrite the stack frame.

        cfg parser: Avoid unnecessary strlen on error case

        When getline() returns -1, the @lineptr argument is never safe to read,
        nor is this recommended.  So when both rc == -1 and EOF conditions
        occur, it is safe to assume we read 0 bytes, without doing the strlen().

        Many thanks to Dhiraj Mishra (@RandomDhiraj) for detecting, documenting
        and reporting the potential risk of a heap buffer overflow here!

        tm: Avoid running hop-by-hop ACK callbacks before reply callbacks

        Commit aaa6b6867 mitigated the effects of a poor HEP connection
        affecting the OpenSIPS's responsiveness by delaying the reply callbacks
        until after the hop-by-hop ACK is sent out.  However, a side-effect in
        doing so is that the reply/ACK HEP packets on un-established calls
        became swapped.  This patch aims to address the issue.

        - avoid READ ops on the @msg pointer, after it's queued for sending
              (subject to race condition with the Diameter Peer process, which
                can free the memory before we read it)
        - lock the "reply_cond" variable *before* queueing the msg for sending
              (avoids race condition where the reply signal arrives *before*
                    we even call pthread_cond_timedwait())
        - rename "req" to "msg", as _dm_send_message() also originates Answers

        aaa_diameter: Fix locking issues when sending requests

        - avoid READ ops on the @msg pointer, after it's queued for sending
              (subject to race condition with the Diameter Peer process, which
                can free the memory before we read it)
        - lock the "reply_cond" variable *before* queueing the msg for sending
              (avoids race condition where the reply signal arrives *before*
                    we even call pthread_cond_timedwait())

        This becomes necessary both when the event_route is not defined, as well

        dm_send_answer() or an internal error occurs before the answer is built.

        Finally, make sure to protect the requests list, since it is actually
        managed by multiple threads part of the "Diameter peer" OpenSIPS worker:

        * dm_update_unreplied_req() - called by the peer's Server Thread
            (i.e. "put a freshly received request on hold")
        * dm_remove_unreplied_req() - called by the peer's Main Thread
            (i.e. "the script writer just built a new reply, msg can be freed")

        rest_client: Improve cURL compatibility when using async()

        This patch aims to fix a regression in 1ecb32491f, breaking the
        "SUCCESS" async download test case.  Mitigation as follows:

        * improved detection for the "Request Sent" state, before putting the
            download on async hold.  It seems that whenever both the
            CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME_T and CURLINFO_REQUEST_SIZE become available,
            the file descriptor can be safely polled on, awaiting the reply.
            Note: there is no official cURL library mechanism to detect this
            state.

        * make the async() statement timeout accessible to modules.  This fixes
        a bug where a GET on a dead HTTP server would time out after
        `curl_timeout` seconds, instead of `async()` seconds (lower).

        Fixes #3286

        * add exponential backoff behavior when reconnecting to a FreeSWITCH
           which is down (1/5/10/30/90 second retries, counting x20 each)

        * add monitoring for the ESL command activity of sockets.  Specifically,
           the module now remembers the last ESL command and will reap sockets
           which both do not have event subscriptions and have not run an ESL
           command in the last 86400 seconds.

        * freeswitch_esl() will now return faster in case the connection is
           down (the lock might still be grabbed by the timer, reconnecting...),
           thus minimizing the risk of a service outage.

        * improved handling for connect error cases (fd management)

        While re-learning the user/pass for sockets learned through MI makes

        This fixes a bug where if a FreeSWITCH socket were defined in both

        removal + reload operation it would remain in a dangling state.

        Avoid chaning the dst_leg on unmatched dialogs, as this might lead to

        which would set a dst_leg, but then "invalidate" the dialog due to the
        bad state - proceeding to a next dialog would not set the dst_leg (as it
        was set by the previous match), leading to an invalid access in the
        second dialog.

        core: make sockaddr_union* and socket_info* arguments, vars and members const

        Make the said pointers const in most places where appropriate. This basically
        ensures that code in modules cannot mess with them intentionally or by a
        mistake.

        It should also have some positive effect on the performance of the code, as
        with those being const * the optimizer would have more room to speculate
        about what code might and might not do.

        There might be also some improvement of static analysis front.

        Most of the change is pretty mechanical, the only functional change is
        the allocation of the socket_info.last_real_port, since those are expected
        to be updated by the underlying protos/modules. Work around that by
        making a separate smaller struct last_real_ports and co-allocate it along
        with the socket_info main backing storage, exposing the non-const pointer
        to that instead.

        Move the prev / next into the semi-private part of the struct.

        Rework net/api_proto_net.h to not require casting handler functions
        to a generic type.

        Next step would be make str members of socket_info into str_const.

        dialog: Mitigate 'dlg_list' PKG fragmentation; Fix dlg_list_ctx memleak

        By using pkg_str_extend() instead of pkg_realloc(), we avoid a constant
        creation of PKG fragments (the buffer will eventually stop growing),
        which seems to gradually fragment the private memory pool, as the MI
        'dlg_list' is continuously polled by various monitoring software.

        As a bonus, this patch also fixes a 'dlg_list_ctx' PKG memory leak
        introduced in 543a40c8ff and only present on OpenSIPS 3.4+.

        json: fix array element deletion

        OpenSIPS incorrectly calls the JSON-C array element deletion function by passing the size of the array instead of the desired count of elements to delete. When attempting to delete from index `0`, it results in the deletion of all elements, while specifying an index greater than `0` leads to no deletion due to overindexing.

        ### Example 1:
        ```
          $json(obj) := "[ 1, 2, 3 ]";
          $json(obj[0]) = NULL;
          xlog("$json(obj)\n");
        ```
        Result:   `[]`
        Expected: `[ 2, 3 ]`

        ### Example 2:
        ```
          $json(obj) := "[ 1, 2, 3 ]";
          $json(obj[1]) = NULL;
          xlog("$json(obj)\n");
        ```

        This patch fixes a bug where both the Date hf and the "iat" PASSporT
        claim could be filled in with a random timestamp value "in the future"
        and still bypass the OpenSIPS "freshness" integrity checks.

        [WIP] statistics: fix crash when creating a series stat

        Under normal circumstances, when a statistic is updated, we first search
        whether it exists, and if not, we add it to the statistics hash.
        However, due to the way it is implemented, searching and adding a
        statistic is not atomic, hence, with high concurrency, when adding a new
        statistic, we might already find an existing one there. In this case,
        the code tries to return that statistic in the `pvar` parameter -
        however, that parameter might be a (r/o) function, hence a crash
        happens. This commit fixes the crash. Close #3136

        However, it returns 0, as if the statistic was properly added - the
        problem with this approach is that from the caller's perspective, we do
        not know whether the statistic was already there or not, to free the
        existing structure - hence this might result into a leak. We are still
        working on a solution for this.

        b2b_logic: do not abort bridging if re-INVITE is rejected with 491

        If the SDP negociation gets rejected with 491, we should not abort
        negociation, since most likely it is an indication that the remote UAS
        is trying to lock its codecs, hence do the same thing we are trying to
        do, but in the other direction.
        If however, the other participant does not send itself a re-INVITE, we
        arm a timer to re-try the bridging according to the RFC 3261, section
        14.1:
           If a UAC receives a 491 response to a re-INVITE, it SHOULD start a
           timer with a value T chosen as follows:

              1. If the UAC is the owner of the Call-ID of the dialog ID
                 (meaning it generated the value), T has a randomly chosen value

        [b2b_entities/logic] use the newly added pref_socket

        When creating a new B2B client, avoid using the UAS side incoming socket as a forced socket. By doing that we override the proto given by the UAC RURI (and forcing to use the same proto as the UAS side - of course, unless we do not do a force send socket from script to manually indicate a new socket/proto). Shortly, th dynamic selection of the correct UAC socket is broken.

        With this change, we do:
        * if the UAS/msg side has a forced socket (from script), we will push it as forced socket to the UAC too (as before this change).
        * if there is no forcing, the current UAS/msg incoming socket is passed as "preferred" socket to the UAC - like use it as time as it fits the RURI proto. This helps in preserving (during the whole b2b logic) the same socket when having multiple sockets serving the same protocol.

        The function already receives a send_socket (a forced socket) which overrides the protocol given by the destination URI. But are cases were we need a milder approach, like a preffered socket to be used if not conflicting with the protocol given by the RURI.
        What we have now:
        * send_socket - it is a forced socket, overrides the proto given by RURI, it will be used for sure
        * pref_socket - a preferred socket, to be used if no send_socket is given and if there is no conflict with the proto given by RURI (in case of a conflict, the pref_socket is discarded and a new socket is looked up based on the RURI info).

           response to a first INVITE with a lower CSeq sequence number on the

        Changes:

        rtp_relay: fix invalid contexts leaked in list

        When a session would have been established on a provisional reply with
        body (i.e. 183), the rtp contexts would have been stored in the list.
        However, if the call would not establish (with a 200 OK), there would be
        no one removing it from the list, even though the context was released -
        this resulted in unexpected and almost impossible to track down invalid
        memory usage.
        The current patch makes sure that the context is removed from the list
        if the call does not establish.

        db_sqlite: fix possible crash when the values is relocated

        When the query does not manage to count the rows in a first shot, the
        values buffer might be reallocated, which can result in a relocation of
        the buffer - if that's the case, we should repoint all the old values to
        the new location, otherwise they will point to an invalid value.

        Many thanks to Rob Moore and Steven Ayre from Dubber for reporting and
        helping us testing and troubleshooting this corner case.

        [dialog] fix dropping empty string dlg vals

        Upon DB recovery (after an OpenSIPS restart) do not drop emtpy string dlg vals - as we do allow creation of such vals via cfg and api and have them saved to DB, it makes all the sense to also restore them
        This triggers some startup warnings when using in-dialog re-INVITE probing.

        dialog: Change dlg->vals locking to be independent

        By making the dlg->vals locking independent from the dialog hash lock,
        working with the dialog API will become less prone to AB/BA deadlocks.
        Sample possible AB/BA deadlock which is now naturally avoided:

          * module "X" timer grabs lock-A, then gets stuck trying to grab
        	lock-B(dialog bucket) through some innocent .store_dlg_val()
        	dialog API call

          * dialog DB timer had grabbed lock-B(dialog bucket), and is now stuck
        	grabbing lock-A while running a DLGCB_DESTROYED callback
        	installed by module "X"

        The main utility of "sched_yield.h" was to provide sched_yield() on

        cachedb_mongodb: fix regression in commit 69ed4f7

        Loading the cachedb_mongodb module alongside the tls_openssl module, but
        before tls_mgm would cause a crash. This is a result of the OpenSIPS versus
        mongoc library openssl initialization issues (initially fixed in commit
        298bf6b). Commit 69ed4f7 split all the openssl related code from the tls_mgm
        module into a new tls_openssl module but some openssl initialization bypasses
        from the cachedb_mongodb module were left to depend on loading the tls_mgm
        module (instead of the new tls_openssl module).

        F_MALLOC: Optimize the free() operation

        Commit bdaaf60b2c introduced a side-effect of gradually moving the
        fragment "action" towards the exponential, non-optimized hash table
        buckets (i.e. buckets 2049 ... 2100).  Here, the fragments were inserted
        in a sorted fashion, with the sorted-insert algorithm costing a O(N)
        iteration on each free operation instead of a simple O(1).

        Consequently, the user experience of this effect is that "dr_reload"
        operations were stalling for 12 minutes (coming up from 24 seconds!),
        when working with large rule sets (millions of rules).  Interestingly
        enough, the stalling was not due to the caching phase -- malloc() --
        rather due to the cleanup phase, when clearing the old rules -- free()!

        To address this issue:

        * we drop the sorted insertion completely for buckets 2049 ... 2100, and
            simply do a list prepend operation: O(1), as with the others
        * we make all allocation requests from these buckets return the next
           bucket (!!), thus guarantee'ing our requested fragment.  Examples:

              malloc(18K) -> now you always get a 32K+ frag, but instantly!
              malloc(37K) -> now you always get a 64K+ frag, but instantly!
        * this does not make F_MALLOC more wasteful, since the extra frag
          space gets split anyway into a new fragment, with the two eventually
          coalescing together again thanks to commit bdaaf60b2c
