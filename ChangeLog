2013-01-21 19:59:28  Liviu Chircu <liviu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9604] :

	Added named flags!
	From now on, the proper way of setting a msg / script / branch flag is by supplying
	an unquoted string: setflag(NEW_FLAG). Same for setsflag/setbflag and
	their isflagset/resetflag/issflagset/resetsflag/isbflagset/resetbflag counterparts.

	Regarding the module parameters which are affected, for now both INT/STRING versions are
	supported, but setting INT flags the classic way is now deprecated, and will throw a
	minor warning at module load.

	The maximum individual flags of a flag type remains 32.


2013-01-21 13:42:36  Liviu Chircu <liviu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9603] :

	New functionality: Script tracing!
	With script tracing, you can better understand the flow of execution in the OpenSIPS script.
	Moreover, you can also trace the values of pseudo-variables, as script execution progresses.

	The blocks of the script where script tracing is enabled will print a line for each individual
	action that is done (e.g. assignments, conditional tests, module functions, core functions, etc.).
	Multiple pseudo-variables can be monitored by specifying a pv_format string
	(e.g. "$ru---$avp(var1)"). The current value of the format will be printed along with each line.

	The logs of multiple traced regions of your script can be differentiated by specifying an
	additional plain string as the 3rd parameter.

	Script tracing can be enabled with: script_trace(log_level, pv_format_string[, info_string])
	To disable script tracing, just: script_trace()



2013-01-21 11:50:34  Razvan Crainea <razvancrainea at opensips dot org>

2013-01-17 17:31:53  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9568] :

	added a script parameter called "tcp_accept_backlog" which is supplied to the listen(...) call done in tcp_main.c.
	Before this patch the value was hardcoded to 10, which is a major bottleneck for performance when dealing with lots of TCP connections. With the new parameter this can be increased for deployments that need higher throughput.

2013-01-10 17:02:44  Saúl Ibarra Corretgé <saul at ag-projects dot com> 
	* [9544] :

	Added external references support to pres-rules

	This adds support for external references to pres-rules documents
	following the OMA specification. In order to achieve this, a few changes
	were made in the presence handling:

	    - The 'pres_rules_auid' module parameter (in presence_xml) controls
	      what mode OpenSIPS operates on: IETF or OMA. Right now this is a
	      global setting since the 2 offer different ways for authorization
	      and are stored in different XCAP documents.

	    - Matching of sub-handling is now done according to the RFC, that
	      is, a sub-handling action of block has less priority than that of
	      allow. For reference, check RFC5025, section 3.2.1.

	Following external references is currently supported only for the
	integrated mode.

	In order to simplify the implemntation, some common code related to XCAP
	handling has been added to the 'xcap' module:

	    - A way for normalizing SIP URIs. A SIP URI may appear encoded or
	      without the SIP scheme inside an XCAP document. The xcap module
	      now provides a function to normalize such URIs.

	    - A way for getting XCAP documents from the DB. The xcap module now
	      contains a generic function which will fetch any XCAP document
	      from the DB.

	A TODO file was also added to the xcap module listing future
	enhancements to be done to the XCAP related modules.

2012-12-13 18:01:42  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9516] :

	- updated the usage of timer functions - when registering a new timer handler, specify a label (human readable identifier) to be used when reporting/loging issues related to that handler 


2012-12-13 16:28:52  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9515] :

	Timers enhancements and fixes:
	- when re-arming a handler (for next triggering), do not count the time spent on running the handler (two triggering must be exactly at "interval" difference)
	- auto-recalibration of timer processes to compensate the time drifting because of running the handlers (running the handlers takes time which usualy accumulates and de-sync the timers)
	- report to logs callbacks the abuse (as timer usage) the timer processes (if a handler uses more than on timer tick -> report it)

	This is step 1, step 2 will be to change in all modules the way the timer are registered (to provide mode info for loging)


2012-12-13 15:48:33  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9514] :

2012-12-11 19:33:35  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9497] :

	- re-work of parse_hname2() (function that parses the name of headers) for fixing:
	   - do not accept spaces in the the name of the headers (not RFC compliant)
	   - do not include trailing spaces (between name and : separator) in the name (this affects detection of non-statdart headers - like "Foo" versus "Foo "
	   - buffer overflow when you have a non-standard header that are a prefix of a standard hdr (like "Content-L" versus "Content-Length") - this may leas to scaning entire memory space of the processs and even overflowing it.
	   - small various optimization in looking for the end of header name (like "From" versus "fromfoo")

	added documentation for rev #9341



2012-10-18 18:13:48  Vlad Paiu <vladpaiu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9341] :

	DB API allows to have multiple WHERE conditions sepparated by OR

	Several performance improvements in the dialog module :

	- the dialog module can be configured to have it's own timer process
	- for the DLG_DELAYED db mode, the dialog deletion is done in the
		timer process ( old way was deleting on the spot, wherever
		that was, eg. SIP worker, MI process, etc )
	- dialog DB structure & usage was reworked, in order to only query 
		by the primary key for all select/delete/update ops
	-  added the option to do bulk dialog deletions in the dialog
		timer process, in order to reduce the number of queries



2012-10-18 10:07:11  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9340] :

	- if using FQDN is SIP URIs of destination, do SIP-wise DNS lookup to find all the IPs+ports behind that SIP URI.
	- the bug was that FQDN entries without A record (but with NAPTR / SRV) were simply discarded at load time (because of DNS failure).


2012-10-18 09:52:23  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9338] :

	- fixed storing the port of GWs (internally) - if GWs are defined via FQDN (subject to NAPTR/SRV lookups), a single GW may have multiple IPS with different ports -> ports needs to be an array also !


2012-10-17 19:21:42  Razvan Crainea <razvancrainea at opensips dot org> 
	* [9336] :

	removed useless update of the dialog variables in db if flush flag is not set

	that share same properties (all active, all inactive+probing...). Refer to the module documentation
	for further details.


2012-10-16 19:32:13  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org>

	xmlNewProp duplicates the string itself.


2012-10-09 10:45:48  Vlad Paiu <vladpaiu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9304] :

	Fixed the ordering of dialog unrefs



2012-10-08 17:04:41  Razvan Crainea <razvancrainea at opensips dot org> 
	* [9303] :

	Enhanced the dispatcher module with a new dispatching algorithm, that allows
	you to determine the load of a server by populating a specific variable. The 
	destinations will be tried in the ascending order of the loads.


2012-10-08 15:56:13  Razvan Crainea <razvancrainea at opensips dot org>

2012-09-30 19:46:57  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9290] :

	- fixed race condition on creating dynamic stats - same stat may be created in the same time from different processes.


2012-09-28 09:40:17  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9289] :

	- fixed compile errors :D


2012-09-27 17:58:08  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org>

2012-09-27 17:52:41  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9285] :

	- fixed ugly bug in parsing the FMT string (combinations of variables with strings) - even if the string was passed as str (pointer+len), the internal code was still looking for null terminator :P...


2012-09-27 12:38:01  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9284] :

	- fixed the evaluation of the name param (for update/reset stat functions) if a FMT is provided


2012-09-27 08:53:42  Liviu Chircu <liviu at opensips dot org>

	Fixed the cfgutils set_count() function issue, where script execution is stopped when returning 0 value.
	The result is now obtained by passing a pvar as the 2nd parameter.


2012-09-24 12:57:16  Liviu Chircu <liviu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9282] :

	Added GPL headers and svn keywords to the recently added files.


2012-09-24 12:02:41  Liviu Chircu <liviu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9281] :

	dispatcher and load_balancer modules now support IP blacklisting based on the destination set/group.
	Similar to the drouting blacklists, these will also be disabled by default when created. It is up to the script
	writer to enable them with the 'use_blacklist' core function.


2012-09-23 22:07:26  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9280] :

	- fixed bug in storing the name of a dynamically created statistic


2012-09-21 15:10:36  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9279] :

	-removed some useless TYPE


2012-09-21 14:50:59  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9278] :

	- added dynamic statistics - anytime you are trying to write (update/reset) a statistic which does not exists, it will be automatically created at runtime (without any pre-definition).


2012-09-21 11:32:26  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9277] :

	- merge $stat() from core into $stat() from statistics module.
	  $stat() is able to cope with dynamic stats (which will be created at runtime)
	- update / reset statistics functions can take the name of statistic as variable, FMT or string


2012-09-21 09:51:49  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9274] :

	fixed the way the tcp conn is looked up when a new timeout is test.
	Special thanks to Saúl Ibarra Corretgé in testing this fix.


2012-09-20 16:29:09  Liviu Chircu <liviu at opensips dot org> 
	* [9273] :

	Recent changes (removing the match_len column) have led to a rework of the index hashing.
	It is now done based on a caseless hashing of the rule match string, and not by its length.
	Consequently, the matching string length is no longer a rule choosing criterion.

	From now on, the primary criterion for chosing a dp rule is the rule's priority. The
	first matching rule, out of matching rules with same priority, is chosen (table order).



2012-09-20 10:28:33  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9270] :

	fixed the list of chars that does not have to be escaped in URI username and URI param - aligned with the RFC3261 requirements.

2012-09-17 11:38:10  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org>

	fixed load/reload behaviour - if a destination is bogus (bad URI, cannot be resolved, etc), it is simply skipped, but do not fail the entire loading.


2012-09-17 09:38:44  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu, <bogdan at opensips dot org> 
	* [9258] :

	several fixes related to timer route:

	* cleanup the dummy SIP request after each execution, do discard whatever parsing/changes done in timer routes -> this avoid mem leaks
	* cleanup the list of AVPs affter each execution -> this avoids inheriting AVPs between the calls of the route (or even worst, between sequential calls of the differen timer routes)
